The agency will provide a detailed proposal later this week, said Mr. Chammany.\nThe boat, which would be operated even in the mouth bar, would be ready in three months.

{"id":1710000,"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-features\/tp-metroplus\/the-ez-way\/article3852544.ece","text":"The EZ way - Chennai - The Hindu\nSeptember 03, 2012 00:00 IST\nSeptember 03, 2012 04:55 IST\nmore-in\nChat Chitra Ravi promotes a novel method of education that helps teachers connect better with students.\n‘Smile’ is her favourite word. She speaks in phrases made around it: Recognition has made us smile more. Smile is a common trait among EZVians (her staff), that smile is carried to all schools we work with. Smile is infectious!\nThat’s Chitra Ravi for you. Founder-CEO, EZVidya, the person behind the “smile” has performed classical dance on stage, modelled and was indeed offered movie roles. Well, movies were an attractive, extended expression of what she was doing, but “I successfully stayed away. I guess I'm too impatient to spend hours in front of the camera,” she smiles.\nShe happened to see a Computer Science textbook. The bubble on its cover picture screamed: “This computer is so fast, I am not!” Do kids have to be fast and accurate like computers, she thought in dismay. And vowed to change the system that would morph kids into mindless desktops. That was 11 years ago.\nThe ‘system overhaul’ wasn't going to be easy. But she had a Masters in English, an MBA, and brimming zeal. She had seen her children’s less-than-happy experience in school. Yes, she would equip herself to promote a form of education that would let children ‘blossom.’ Bidding goodbye to her family business, she gathered a small education-passionate group and floated EZVidya. A tad ironical, if you read ‘EZ’ as ‘easy.’\nChitra’s premise: Education today does not encourage children to think. It's not nerdy or uncool to think! “Happy thinking” is possible and through it, children will learn to ‘look deep’ for critical\/analytical thinking, ‘look beyond’ for creative ideas, ‘look around’ for social\/environmental happenings (transportation, photo-synthesis) and ‘look within’ to reflect. Children should ask: Why am I learning this? What is the significance? And find answers.\n“I don't tell teachers what to do,” she says. “I ask questions, get them to think.” Are we showing the children the soul of the subject, say Chemistry? “Education must combine cognitive and affective aspects of learning,” she says. “It must aid self-discovery. The process can be triggered through lessons in class.” And children should learn to be emotionally safe. EZVidya builds tools to help teachers connect with students of today, and perfect the teacher-student relationship. They let students discover their unique talents, not fit them into a pre-determined frame-work. The package for schools includes teacher training, technology and aesthetically brought out materials. “Our Chrysalis textbooks are designed to create a 21st Century learning environment. They aim to build skills essential for ‘Living Well.’ It's an LKG- Class 5 curriculum, prepared in-house.” Her Techmate platform gives teachers classroom management widgets. It is simple PDF, interactive, and can be projected. There is also voiced poetry. “We are trying new methods using the mobile, which everyone is familiar with,” she said.\nFeedback has been good, she says. Some have called them true CCE tools. “Schools have told us that children they thought dull were the most participative when our materials are used. With Chrysalis, there's no need for persuasion. Our books\/materials cater to the multiple intelligences of the children, allow space for expression. It’s time for our dull books to move over.”\nShe and her 130-strong staff see EZVidya as a movement. Each feels he’s a contributing member. They meet students and teachers, get parents to participate actively and train teachers to listen sharply. We innovate constantly, re-visit goals, remain dynamic and robust, she says. “We look at the heart of education.” In the middle of all this, Chitra tweets actively, visits schools across India and abroad, attends national\/international educational forums. And miraculously manages time for family, reading, music and friends.\nIt is a long haul, but Chitra is optimistic. EZ Vidya works with over 400 schools across India, and partners several organisations including Wipro, Nokia, Dell, IBM, American India Foundation and the Azim Premji Foundation, in their educational initiatives.

The Budget stresses on the path of fiscal consolidation, with the objective of reaching the milestone of 3.0% fiscal deficit by FY17. Besides consolidation, the quality of adjustment has improved with subsidy expenditure reigned in at 2.0% of GDP, down from 2.3% in FY14 and capital expenditure increasing to 1.8% of GDP, up from 1.7% in FY14.\nIn addition, adequate sop has been provided for incentivising financial savings by relaxing the slab for income tax by `50,000, exempting resources raised by banks for long term infrastructure from regulatory pre-emption, extension of withholding tax for bonds and streamlining of KYC data across the financial sector. With improvement in economic growth, this will enable the Savings Ratio to move towards 32-33%, from 30.1% in FY13.\nOn the inflation control and management front, the creation of a Price Stabilization Fund to mitigate near term food price risks is a laudable initiative."}

When they deglamourise, it is news. I put the question to Swara Bhaskar, a competent actor who has been trying to find her way to the top creative echelons of the industry for some time. However, when she can play the so-called urban girl-next-door with ease, she is expected to do glossy stuff?\n“I’ve always assumed that the bigger the star the bigger the news really! But I guess what it is, is that when you are used to seeing an actor in a certain way, then, when they shed that image it stands out. Like when Katrina Kaif shed her Barbie doll image in Rajneeti .”\nSwara says, “I guess with actors like me because we are really still on our way up and the only time people really see us is onscreen that is the image they have of us – desi, deglamourised and perhaps even plain. Then when they see us on the red carpet it makes them sit up. I’ve never cared much about this. My face has always been this. If people never saw the possibility of it looking glamorous, only because I’ve played de-glam roles so far, that’s their lack of imagination, not my problem. Sorry am I being harsh? (laughs)…I mean it though.”\nSwara says she sees herself as an actor and a heroine. “I think I have a fair balance of memorable supporting parts ( Tanu Weds Manu , its sequel, Raanjhanaa and the forthcoming Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo ) and protagonist\/ lead roles in women-centric films ( Listen Amaya , Machhli Jal Ki Rani Hai and the forthcoming Nil Battey Sannata ). So yes, I think these heroine oriented times are a great spell for me too.”\nWhen one watches Tanu Weds Manu Returns and get the news that she is playing Salman Khan’s sister in Prem Ratan Dhan Payo , one gets a sense that yet another actor has surrendered to the thankless space of heroine’s friend and hero’s sister. But then there is Nil Battey Sanatta , where she is the leading the charge as the mother. “As I said I don’t see myself as a supporting actor or feel limited or typecast. I am an outsider to the industry, I’m not a star child, I haven’t had a mentor or a god-father, or a famous boyfriend…. I’ve worked my way up the audition route. I knew it would be the long slow route. But I have no complaints. This journey has made me the actor I am. I did it my way and I did it right. And continue to do so,” she counters.\nNil Battey Sannaata , Swara explains, is a colloquial saying for a good-for-nothing and is a beautiful story about a mother and daughter. “I had to play the mother of a 15-year-old. It was a huge challenge to play an age group so much older than myself. I had to put on eight kilos for the film. The film is a lovely heart warming tale about dreams. And the power of a dream. Debutant Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari is a sensitive and talented director, and her husband Nitesh Tiwari (director of Bhootnath Returns and Aamir Khan’s forthcoming Dangal ) has written the film.”\nBut her confidence appears shaky when she signs a film like Sabki Bajegi Band. Desperate measures or a case of poor execution of a promising idea? “Well, I think that, and I’m saying this in a general sense and not specific to a particular film, actors are a very vulnerable lot. In the sense that we give auditions to prove that we suit the part, but no director ever gives an audition to an actor. So unless it’s an established director with a body of work behind him or her, there is no way to know their skill level before filming. A lot of films we actors sign is on the basis of faith or assumption or based on reading the script. But the truth is that there is a big slip between cup and lip, when it comes to a film going from script to floor to post production. And really actors only have control on their own performance and nothing else, especially if they are not big stars. So yes, often films don’t turn out to be what one thought.”\nShe adds, “I’ve never regretted any decision or film that I did. I’ve always taken away at least one positive lesson from every film I did and many friends and that is true of Sabki Bajegi Band too.” If people never saw the possibility of my face looking glamorous that’s their lack of imagination, not my problem\nRelated Topics"}

But Pakistani cement consignments were kept waiting for so long at Mumbai harbour that the cement solidified due to the moisture in the air. The Pakistanis were understandably furious. The hold-up was because of the mandatory requirement to have the quality of the cement certified by the Indian Standards Institute.\nTo speed up the process, it was decided that inspectors from the Indian Standards Institute would be sent directly to Pakistan to check out the cement quality at the factory sites. The system is working well  except for one snag. Port trust authorities are rattled by the sight of huge containers from Pakistan at the harbour with stickers which announce 'Cleared by ISI', since those letters are also the fear-rousing initials of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency.\nA 1-2-3 tussle of a different sort is taking place in the CPI. There is a wrangle over who is the senior-most in the party after A.B. Bardhan, the 81-year-old general-secretary. Bardhan, who succeeded Indrajit Gupta as general-secretary in 1996, indicated in August this year that he would like to step down from active politics. That means the party will have to look for a new face as general-secretary when it meets in Hyderabad in March next year at the party Congress.\nParty secretary D. Raja, a familiar face on TV, who is close to Bardhan and is generally party spokesperson, seemed the most likely choice as successor. But two others have staked their claim. Sudhakar Reddy, the party secretary from Andhra, is a grassroots leader who is respected for his skills as a strategist and organiser. Gurudas Dasgupta is the party's parliamentary leader and AITUC general-secretary and represents the powerful Bengal lobby. To prevent an unseemly power struggle, a proposal has been mooted that the CPI amend its constitution and create four posts of deputy general-secretary. If a consensus eludes the next congress over the choice of general secretary, Bardhan may be persuaded to continue for a while and the other three appointed his deputies."}

The financial position of the municipality was not known as municipal officials had not tabled the financial statement before the council till date.\nWhen the chairperson tried to convince the agitating councillors, they staged a walkout condemning her attitude. They also sent copies of the petition to the municipal administration commissioner and the Collector seeking immediate action.\nRelated Topics"}

And considering that he frequently shifted home, this was no mean task.\nThe Prince Charming of Carnatic Music, G.N. Balasubramaniam, GNB to fans and friends, both of which were legion, presided over the annual conference of the Music Academy in 1958, exactly fifty years ago.\nOn January 1, 1959, the birudu and insignia of Sangita Kalanidhi was conferred on him and as befitting his stature “a large and distinguished gathering of musicians and music lovers was present at the P.S. High School pandal, where the function was held and cheered GNB” (The Hindu, January 2, 1959). It must be remembered here that the Academys’s present auditorium was still being built.\nGuru-sishya relationship\nThe Governor of Kerala, Dr. B Ramakrishna Rao presided over the event and in his speech “stressed the value of guru-sishya relationship and said that the lack of that personal relationship between the teacher and the taught was responsible for the calamitous things that that had happened in the field of general education.”\nIt was rather ironic that the Governor chose guru-sishya relationship as the theme of his talk, for GNB was rather unique in that respect.\nBarring his initial learning under his father G.V. Narayanaswami Iyer, some further training under Madurai Subramania Iyer and still later a couple years under Tiger Varadachariar, GNB hardly had any guru to speak of. Most of his knowledge had been acquired by listening intently to music, assimilating it and later making it his own, giving it his unique stamp by means of his great intellect.\nNew phenomenon\nHis briga based music was a new phenomenon in the world of Carnatic Music. In fact, the citation mentioned that with “a unique style of his own and a speedy virtuosity of voice he gained a large popularity and a school of followers and pupils.” Of course, not everyone felt comfortable with his music and some detractors even went to extent of calling it ‘English Sangeetham,’ owing to GNB possessing a BA (Hons) degree in English literature.\nIt is interesting to read that the Academy’s sadas began on that day with a prayer sung by KV Narayanaswami, then a rising star. It must have made up somewhat for the absence of KVN’s guru, Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar who was in those years not accepting any concert opportunities at the Music Academy. GNB must have missed Ariyakkudi keenly, for to him Ariyakkudi was the very embodiment of music.\nAmong the vidwans assembled on the occasion, mention must be made of GNB’s close friends, T Chowdiah and Palani Subramania Pillai. Both spoke on the occasion and Palani in his speech complimented GNB for the way in which he conducted the Academy’s annual conference that year. Madurai Mani Iyer too was present and said “that he was very happy that his friend GNB was honoured on the occasion. Whenever GNB and he met, they would be speaking for hours on the intricacies of music. The music of GNB was noted for its verve.” GNB was still a relative youngster and there were seniors present as well. Among them, Tiruvizhimizhalai Subramania Pillai (the first nagaswaram artist to be conferred the title of Sangita Kalanidhi) and Annasami Bhagavatar, the Harikatha exponent, spoke.\nIn his acceptance speech, GNB said that he owed his present position to “his father, Tiger Varadachariar and Sri Ramanuja Iyengar.” He must have remembered the early days when Ariyakkudi was a frequent visitor at home. That was a period when GNB’s speed of singing had worried his father no end and he had consulted Ariyakkudi about it. The latter had said that a natural voice should never be tampered with and had encouraged GNB to sing the way he felt best.\nGNB had always prided himself on being an “Academy boy” for he had performed along with Tiger Varadachariar as early as 1932 when the Teachers College of Music was begun by the Academy. His speech therefore also paid tributes to the institution. He said that “The Expert Committee of the Music Academy was an august body and he had not had the courage to reject the offer of Presidentship of the conference.” He said that “art was big and an artist was a mere dwarf before a giant”.\nUnknowingly or perhaps otherwise, GNB had also sparked off another revolution in Carnatic music, albeit a minor one. With him, the trend of referring to musicians by initials and not by village name began and his were perhaps the most famous initials among them all. And so he wound his speech up with the request that “the musically minded public would continue to call him “GNB””!\n(The author can be contacted at >srirambts@gmail.com )\nRelated Topics"}

Henceforth, we will be free for the next few months until we get admission to the next academic year. As we are from a middle-class family, we cannot afford the huge amount demanded by the private computer training centre. It will be helpful to us if the Palike can get us a free computer coaching centre,” said Jayanth, a 1st PUC student.\nThe students informed that many of their friends residing in other wards of BBMP are accessing this facility.\nWhen the City Express, took the issue with the area corporator N Veeranna he said, “We were planning to set up a computer centre under the Palike. But as we did not have the required strength in the class, we had to put it on hold. But we have a provision under the BBMP to recommend my ward students to the Social Welfare Department, to get the coaching desired by the students. We indeed gave the names of my ward students for IAS and KAS coaching classes.”\nHe further said that the desired student can drop in the their application letters at his ward office.\nMost of the streets in Old K R Puram like New Bazaar Street, Old Bazaar Street, Muniyappanagar are gifted with clean concrete roads and the rest of the roads in the ward are asphalted. When City Express asked Veeranna about the development works he has undertaken so far, he said, “Three parks have been developed in the ward at Bhattarahalli. We have a plan to set up a tree park in about two-and-half acre soon. As there are no government property in the area, we could not develop more playgrounds.”\nIt was also found that thousands of two-wheelers take the short cut road, passing through the under bridge of K R Puram Railway station. “Many take this short cut, as it saves around six kilometres to reach Whitefield from K R Puram and vice-versa. But as most of those who use this route are software professionals, the incidents of miscreants threatening commuters at knife point to rob valuables are on rise after 9 pm,” said Babu Reddy, a resident.\nOn the increasing cases of robbery in the ward, Veeranna said that the saidarea does not fall under his ward. “It is a railway property. But with the intention of public safety I will have a word with the police to increase patrolling.” Pramila, a resident of the ward complained that they do not get Cauvery water.”We totally rely on the borewell for water. It will be better if we are supplied with Cauvery water.” On the prevailing water issues, Veeranna said, “We do not have water supply by the Water Board. We are supplying water to the residents with borewells and private tankers.”"}

While Indigo has appeared keen to acquire a stake in Air India, the airline has said it would not be prepared to bear the state-owned carrier’s unsustainable liabilities.\nAir India has total debt of about Rs. 52,000 crore, comprising of Rs. 22,000 crore as aircraft loans and the rest as working capital loans and other liabilities. Air India has financed working capital through borrowings from a consortium of 25 banks.\n“The new owner will take the airline’s reasonable working capital of around Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000 crore,” another official said on condition of anonymity.\nPrimary interest\nIndiGo’s President and Whole-Time Director Aditya Ghosh told the budget airline’s employees in a letter last week: “Our interest in Air India is primarily in its international operations… In that journey, we are not going to take on debts and liabilities that could not be supported by the new restructured operations.”\nAir India’s prime real estate properties spread across the country and abroad may not be a part of its stake sale process, the senior aviation ministry official said, adding that its aircraft, parking and landing slots, international air traffic rights, human resources would go under the hammer.\nThe privatisation process would not impact the national carrier’s air services agreements till the time substantial ownership and effective control vests with a domestic owner, the official added.\n“Air India’s real estate, including land and buildings, and art treasures may not be a part of the disinvestment process. It may be hived off to a shell company,” the official said.\nSome of its prime real estate properties include a building at Nariman Point and another at the old airport in Santa Cruz, both in Mumbai, freehold land in Chennai’s Annasalai, an office in Baba Kharak Singh Marg, Connaught Place, New Delhi, and freehold land and buildings in Hyderabad.

How did you go from city kid to an adventurous lover of the great outdoors? I started to do my first wilderness trips when I was 14 years old. I did a lot of scuba diving.\nWhen I was 15, I did a lot of mountaineering; at 16, I lived on a ranch in Wyoming, went out to the west to do some desert survival. I just progressed slowly. I was a city kid. I was born and raised in Manhattan, and yet somehow I found my passion in the wilderness and that became then a passion for education and that became a passion for television.\nWhat has been your most memorable or incredible adventure thus far? I think for me as someone who has studied anthropology and as someone who appreciates remote cultures, the most spectacular experience was living with the Anga people in the Koki village of Papua New Guinea. The lifestyle of the Anga is not terribly different from the other people in that region, but what was fascinating, what was unknown for me as well as the rest of the world was this mummification ritual that had not been performed in over 50 years.\nWho chooses the destinations for each adventure? The objective is to build a series, a platform for the series that’s as broad as possible, so that we have the longevity. We want to make a show that’s a hit and goes on for many years. It was a group of us, the production company and the researchers who have their feelers out around the world trying to figure out what locations, stories and experts would be the best for Discovery. We looked at around 120 different stories and then picked the best 20. Then from those best 20, we picked the best 10 and then from the best 10 we picked the best six or eight. So, there are a lot of us involved and then, hopefully, we got the best stories on TV.\nDo you have a place that you would like to go to? I’ve been to, I think, 43 countries, but there’s so many more.\nI think for next season if we have our second season, I’d love to go to Antarctica and Australia, just so I can say I’ve been to all seven continents. I’d love to go to Nepal, to India, to China, to let me think, some other great stories. The Artic is always tough to film in, but I would think the northern parts, where the Inuit and the Eskimo cultures have some fascinating things that they could show me.\nDo you ever feel as though you’ll run out of mysteries and truths to explore? How do you keep things fresh and exciting? Well, I’ve been fortunate enough to have explored a lot of the bigger religious mysteries from the Ark of the Covenant to the Holy Grail and then on this series, I’ve been to Egypt many times and seen a lot of their great stories. I don’t know what, one of the bigger ones. There are some major explorers and expeditions that lost their ships or that got stranded or disappeared that I would love to explore.\nWith the Noah’s Ark episode or any of the biblical [oriented expeditions], is there ever a worry about pissing certain people off ? Well, it’s certainly a mystery.\nWhether it’s a myth or not is to be determined. I think there are people, as you see in the show, who believes very strongly in the reality of Noah and the Ark.\nAnd I’m not one to question or disrespect someone’s faith if it’s based on their feelings instead of on the more tangible proof that we might require. But I think that mysteries and myths are equally important. We appreciate the sense of the unknown and my job is to just explore that on behalf of viewers.\nWhat is your best tip for surviving in the wilderness? My best tip for surviving in the wilderness; it will depend on the wilderness and what it is you’re doing there, but I think as a general rule prepare. Prepare for the unexpected because you don’t want to find yourself in a situation where you don’t have the capacity to rescue yourself."}

From 2003 to 2013, the number of scientists and engineers residing in the US rose from 21.6 million to 29 million. An important factor in that increase: over the same time period, the number of immigrant scientists and engineers went from 3.4 million to 5.2 million.\nImmigrants went from making up 16 per cent of the science and engineering workforce to 18 per cent, according to the report. In 2013, the latest year for which numbers are available, 63 per cent of US immigrant scientists and engineers were naturalised citizens, while 22 per cent were permanent residents and 15 per cent were temporary visa holders.\nOf the immigrant scientists and engineers in the US in 2013, 57 per cent were born in Asia, 20 per cent were born in North America (excluding the US), Central America, the Caribbean or South America. As many as 16 per cent were born in Europe, 6 per cent were born in Africa and less than 1 per cent were born in Oceania, the report said. The NCSES report found that immigrant scientists and engineers were more likely to earn post-baccalaureate degrees than their US-born counterparts.\nIn 2013, 32 per cent of immigrant scientists reported their highest degree was a master's (compared to 29 per cent of US-born counterparts) and 9 per cent reported it was a doctorate (compared to 4 per cent of US-born counterparts).\nThe most common broad fields of study for immigrant scientists and engineers in 2013 were engineering, computer and mathematical sciences, and social and related sciences. Over 80 per cent of immigrant scientists and engineers were employed in 2013, the same percentage as their US-born counterparts.\nAmong the immigrants in the science and engineering workforce, the largest share (18 per cent) worked in computer and mathematical sciences, while the second-largest share (8 per cent) worked in engineering.\nThree occupations - life scientist, computer and mathematical scientist, and social and related scientist - saw substantial immigrant employment growth from 2003 to 2013. Data presented in the NCSES report is from the 2013 SESTAT, an integrated data system that provides a comprehensive picture of individuals educated or employed in science and engineering fields."}

T.S. ATUL SWAMINATHAN reports\nThe Metropolitan Transport Corporation regularly receives requests from residents across the city to ensure small buses are introduced in their neighbourhoods, enabling access to interior areas. Among the latest such requests is a call for a small bus service between Chromepet and Nemilichery (not to be confused with the Nemilichery that is around 30 kilometres away and through which the Outer Ring Road courses).\nThe Nemilichary in question is around 4 kilometres from Chromepet and introduction of a small bus between these localities would benefit residents of Jain Nagar, Maruthi Nagar, A.K. Nagar and A.G.S. Colony, Hasthinapuram. In fact, the request for the service has come from these residents.\nK. Kumar, a resident of AGS Colony, says, “There are no direct bus services between Nemilichery and Chromepet. Even share autorickshaws don’t ply between these localities. Residents either rely on private transport or walk up to the Hasthinapuram bus terminus to reach Chromepet. If small buses are introduced, covering these areas, it would be of immense help to commuters, especially senior citizens.”\nAGS Colony, off Rajendra Prasad Road, is a thickly-populated residential area and is proximate to Chitlapakkam and Chromepet. Most of the residents belong to the middle-income group and spending on autorickshaws on a daily basis will eat considerably into their budgets.\n“Commuting by MTC buses to Hasthinapuram from Chromepet and other areas is an ordeal. The frequency of the services 66A (Hasthinapuram to Kundrathur), M52 (Hasthinapuram to Pozhichalur), M18G (Hasthinapuram to Guduvanchery), 52B (Hasthinapuram to Broadway) and 500A (Hasthinapuram to Chengalpet) should be increased, and new services should be introduced,” commuters point out.\n“Also, several representations to the MTC officials to introduce direct buses to north Chennai and various parts of south Chennai from the Hasthinapuram bus terminus have gone in vain. Buses to Anna Square, Poonamalle, Avadi, Thiruvanmiyur, Adyar and Ambattur should be introduced from the terminus. Now, we have to go to Chromepet to take a bus for north Chennai.”\nCommuters also complain about the lack of basic civic amenities at the terminus. “The bus terminus does not have proper toilets, clean drinking water, spacious shelters and an adequate seating arrangement,” K Rajendran, one of the commuters, says. Efforts to contact the MTC authorities proved futile.\nRelated Topics"}

VIDYA SARANYAN\nA glittering visual configuration that stirred the consciousness, ‘Pannum Bharatamum' was a dance feature on the Thevaram. Choreographed and presented by veteran dancer Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam and her disciples, it was organised by Sri Krishna Gana Sabha for the Yagnaraman July Fest.\nThe production featuring select works of Tamil Saivaite saints Appar, Tirugnanasambandar, Sundarar and Manickavachagar, has grown from strength to strength in more ways than one since it was first staged in 1984.\nNot surprisingly, the choreography and the performance boasted of different planes of interpretation. A master of bhava, Padma demonstrated just how hyperbole and subtlety, humour and solemnity can accentuate the sacred voices. The extensive artistic and scholastic skills of the veteran dancer streamed the Thevaram into a wholesome experience of rasa.\nSplit second timing and coordination by dancers Aparna, Swati, Nivedita, Mahati Kannan, Ramya, Srinidhi, Anugraha and Neeraja emphasised their effervescent dancing. The group's seamless integration of adavus and charis underscored their teacher's well-known viewpoint in dance. While their costumes were colourful, the multiplicity in designs jarred.\nFor the most part, the programme was charted so that a group piece was alternated with a solo number by Padma. The initial piece ‘Purvarangam' performed by the entire group was followed by Appar's words which recounted how he quelled the five senses to seat Lord Siva in his heart.\nMyriad moods\nIn the next number, one could only marvel at the innumerable ways Padma coaxed the stubborn parrot, fondly addressed as ‘madakiliye' by Tirugnanasambandar, in Suddha Saveri. This piece has been performed by the dancer numerous times before, yet it retained its sparkle so that the anticipation held sway for the audience until the parrot finally uttered the sacred name.\nMemories of Padma taking wing with the unique karnas to depict the parrot, came together with that evening's exposition of the maiden's attempts to hear her beloved's name. Typical of her approach, here too one saw Padma's diversity of emotions, ranging from wonder and fear to love and devotion, adding strength and patina.\nResplendent in her white and gold costume, Padma's specialised body stances brought home the majesty of Siva, who burnt Tripura with his third eye and as the one who showered his grace on the true devotee for Sundaramurthy's Thevaram.\nA highlight\nAmong the many depictions, ‘Sambho Mahadeva' struck a special note. This Sundarar lyric that came at the tail end saw the veteran dancer pour out the frustrations of the bhakta. She confronted a God who remained deaf to repeated pleas for salvation. Even as her body language outlined that this was no meek or humble missive, the rasika was made clearly alive of the extraordinary familiarity of Sundarar for whom Siva was an inseparable friend.\nAnother solo number that struck a poignant note was in Kaapi, performed by Mahati Kannan whose eloquent eyes outlined the naiveté of the girl who is mesmerised by Siva as the alms seeker. The superb quality of music in the form of vocals and nattuvangam of Gayatri and Radhika, and sensitive music by veena vidwan Kannan added to the flamboyance of the evening, especially as the orchestra gallantly followed the doyenne's improvisations.\nRelated Topics"}

After this destruction, starts the process of creation, and this is called Satkriti,\" says Salil, creator of the Satvik Veena and son of Grammy award-winning Pt Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, about his latest album, titled Satkriti. His last album was Strings of Freedom, a tribute to 50 years of his father's musical journey.\nHis third album this year, Satkriti is, according to Salil, \"a magical, musical, mystical\" creation fused with intense ragas, Jog and Kirwani. According to Salil, Shiva's third eye represents divine knowledge and enlightenment. \"His dance, taandav, is nothing but an expression of\nfeelings and his music is just\nthe same,\" says Salil, who was in Chandigarh recently on an invitation from Pracheen Kala Kendra. Salil also presented a short music concert at KC Residency on Monday and was accompanied by Kaushik Konwar on tabla.\nTo communicate the intensity and energy of Shiva's dance and music, Bhatt has chosen the powerful Raga Jog. \"This raga has an amazing universal scale, and is used in all music systems, from Carnatic, Hindustani and Western to jazz and blues,\" says Salil.\nHe picked Raga Kirwani for similar reasons. \"The raga has a much wider horizon; it appeals to the Western and Eastern scales of music, and exists in Hindustani and Carnatic music as well as in folk music across our country,\" he says. While he named the veena after his son Satvik, this album is titled after his daughter, Satkriti and he dedicates it to all girls and daughters. \"Both Satvik and Satkriti are synonyms of Shiva,\" says the artiste.\nBhatt says that his aim is to simplify classical music so that the common man can tune in to it. \"With this album as with all my music, I want to unify my listeners and bring them closer. I want to end the differences, and my weapon is good traditional music that enriches, enhances and cleanses the soul,\" says Salil."}

A new programme was announced online on Tuesday.\nAkthar was scheduled to take part in the inaugural ceremony and some other sessions. Rakshanda Jalil was to participate in a session with him on the second day.\n■  Irked by the remarks of Vikram Sampath, one of the founding directors of the festival, two writers had opted out of the festival on November 25.\n■  According to Dayanand T K and Arif Raja, Kannada writers, Sampath’s comment on the ‘award wapsi’ campaign was in poor taste.\n■   Former minister Jairam Ramesh and Malayalam writer Sarah Joseph are also among the invitees excusing themselves from the festival.\n■  The withdrawals prompted Sampath to step down as director of the festival.  However, he will participate in panel discussions.\n■  Shinie Antony said Akthar had written to the hosts saying something important had come up, preventing him from attending the festival.\n■  “Till the festival ends, we cannot say for sure who will or will not attend,” she said.\nWell-known writer and historian Ramachandra Guha has described the protests as an “ill-judged boycott by writers who had previously agreed to speak.”\n“To agree to speak and then pull out because one does not agree with the views of one of the organisers is to close off debate altogether. It displays, to use a word in vogue lately, intolerance,” he has said in a letter to the festival organisers.\nHe will speak on ‘Eight Threats to Freedom of Expression’ at the festival on Saturday.\nHe says he had declined the invitation to the event since he was at work finishing a book. “However, the organisers have now renewed the invitation, and I have accepted,” he says.\nHis statement explains his decision: “Writers have always had differing views; we should welcome this. I disagree with some things Vikram Sampath has said or written; just as he surely disagrees with some things I have said or written.

It will have halls and a combination of dormitories and rooms for the attendants.\nThe block is to be constructed and made functional within the next two years. A senior AIIMS official giving details of this ambitious project said: “The aim, of course, is to provide a clean, comfortable and safe residential facility to the relatives or attendants of the patients and for those who come for a follow-up treatment here. The block is close by, which will ensure that the attendants don’t need to travel long distances.”\n“Several of the cases\/patients who come to the institute are from nearby States and many patients are so poor that they cannot afford a stay and meals in the Capital,” he added.\nThe work for building the block has been assigned to the Hospital Consultancy Corporation India Ltd for developing drawings, obtaining approvals, floating tenders and supervising the construction. Previously a memorandum of understanding was singed with thePower Grid Corporationof India Ltd, which has donated Rs.2.9 crore as the first instalment under its corporate social responsibility.\nAIIMS spokesperson Dr. Amit Gupta said: “This is common pool facility. It will cater to those coming to the main AIIMS and the trauma centre.\nHowever, since it is a kilometre or so away from the main hospital, it will primary cater to those at the trauma centre. However anyone with a registration of AIIMS can avail of the facilities here. This block will be in addition to the existing facility.”\nRelated Topics"}

Gouridasan Nair\nTime for serious introspection\nThe ruling alliance retained the seat by the skin of its teeth In the May elections, LDF had won by a margin of 5,000 votes\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As expected, Thiruvambadi proved to be a tough call for the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF). The ruling alliance retained the seat by the skin of its teeth, something that should make LDF managers sit up and take note of. For only six months ago, it had won the seat by an impressive margin of over 5,000 votes.\nThe State has not seen any major realignment of political forces since the last election and the only visible change in Kerala's political landscape had happened in favour of the LDF - the decision of K. Karunakaran and his supporters, now part of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), to throw their lot with the LDF. The Jama-at-e-Islami and People's Democratic Party (PDP) are still very much with the LDF. So is the Sunni Muslim faction led by Kanthapuram A. P. Abubacker Musaliar.\nGenerating sympathy\nThe untimely death of Mathai Chacko, who had wrested the seat from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the May election, had generated enough of a sympathy for the LDF in the constituency and the Saddam Hussein factor was at play precisely at the time when the election campaign was picking. If the LDF could not repeat the kind of victory it had scored in the May Assembly election despite all these propitious ingredients, the alliance would have to look elsewhere for its reasons.\nOne basic factor that could have worked against the LDF is the fact Thiruvambadi is a traditional UDF stronghold. Mathai Chacko could wrest it mainly for three reasons other than the political and organisational backing the LDF received across the State. The first was the massive pro-LDF wave that swept the UDF to political margins in May. The second was the IUML decision to import M. C. Mayin Haji, facing serious charges in connection with the Marad incidents, as its candidate in Thiruvambadi. The third was the personal charisma that Mathai Chacko had among the settler population in the constituency.\nThis time round, the UDF took remedial measures on all these fronts. It found a local candidate in V. K. Ummer Master to take on LDF's George M. Thomas and put up a strong fight to wrest the seat back. Had they succeeded in securing another 125 votes, the result would have been different.\nThe message of the Thiruvambadi by-election could be that the State's electoral politics is back to square one, where the two alliances can fight bitter battles and swing matters their different way with a little help from here and there.\nSince the political factors remained the same or was marginally in favour of the LDF after the reinforced NCP offering it full support, the LDF leadership would have to find an answer for the question why it could not take its tally upward.\nThere is another difficulty for the LDF. If it takes that it did benefit from the support extended to it by K. Karunakaran and his supporters, it would imply that it would have lost the election if the political equations had remained the same as in May.\nThat would amount to an admission that the LDF could not raise its campaign pitch to the level that obtained in the State and the constituency in May.\nThat would be trickier than saying that the Karunakaran factor had no impact in the constituency.\nRelated Topics"}

V\nApril 08, 2006 00:00 IST\nMarch 23, 2012 12:41 IST\nmore-in\nBreaking all barriers, Mohammed Iqbal travelled all the way from Karachi to be amidst strangers who are as amicable as he has been to them, says HARJEET KAUR ALLAGH\nWhat could not be imagined in the past 55 years- bringing the two countries closer, seems possible now IQBAL Standing tall with a height of over six feet, the amicable Pathan is charm personified. Doing what he is best at- luring customers with the onyx artefacts, salt lamps, melamine and micro wave friendly dinner sets, traditional jootis and spice powders to enrich the culinary prowess of Indian gourmet cooks, he is loving every bit of it. Mohammed Iqbal from Karachi flashes a familiar smile at people passing by his stall put up at Swaraj Maidan as part of the on-going 32nd All India Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition. The annual event that attracts traders and artisans from across the country has, this time around, brought a Pathan from across the Indian border. Iqbal's stall is one of the star attractions of the exhibition. He has visited many other cities in India thanks to the Governments of the two countries who threw open the borders.\nSkilfully crafted\nIqbal mainly trades in onyx, which is an expensive stone mined only in Baluchistan, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. He has been in the business for the last 13 years. All the pieces of onyx have been skilfully crafted and manufactured in Karachi. The smooth vases, pedestals and centre tables are machine-made with precision, while the animal forms are meticulously sculpted. The various images created with onyx in his stall include table clocks in the shape of an eagle, fish, a leaf, an umbrella and a heart shape. Animals and birds like elephants, tigers, panthers, frogs, tortoise and beautiful swans and pots and vases have a glossy pearl finish to them. Even the Nandi that Siva rides on has been carved in Karachi and brought here to meet popular demand in the south. The price range of the artefacts begins at Rs. 50 and touches Rs. 2.5 lakh. Each of the two gigantic flowerpots at the entrance weighs nearly four hundred kilograms. The Pakistani offers unique salt herbal lamps with therapeutic qualities. Made of naturally found rock salt, the lamps once lit spread a soothing effect. Besides being ornamental and colourful, their impact helps cleans impurities in human blood. It is particularly recommended for people suffering from stress, depression, blood pressure, fever and asthma. The rays emitted from the lamp leave a soothing impact on the eyes.\nSense of humour\nIf the unbreakable crockery is microwave friendly and priced reasonably, the traditional Pakistani masalas can spice up any delicacy. Jahnamaaz or a tiny rug, used to kneel down on while praying, is weaved exquisitely with an image of Makkah on it. Buyers of the rugs get a string of prayer beads free. \"I am the proud father of two sons and a daughter but I have only one wife,\" he chuckles. Though language is a barrier, the strong emotions and the warmth overcomes it all. Refusing to be a pessimist, Iqbal talks of the light at the end of the tunnel. \"What could not be imagined in the past 55 years- bringing people of the two countries closer, seems possible now,\" he says expressing hope. People of both the countries have similar ethnic backgrounds and they can become a force to reckon with if united, he feels. \"Animosity between the two governments notwithstanding, the heart of a common man in Pakistan is full of warmth for his Indian brethren,\" he says emotionally.\nRelated Topics"}

This makes them highly vulnerable to floods, extreme temperatures, cyclones and storms. The poor and slum-dwellers remain the most vulnerable,” Somesh Kumar observed.\nOn solid waste management, he said, “Hyderabad generates 4000 MT of waste.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was also ruled out yesterday for up to eight weeks - and Jack Wilshere appears unlikely to return this month - but it is the Cazorla news that will impact most on Arsenal.\n\"Santi is not doing too well, he has some Achilles problems,\" said Wenger. \"His knee is doing well but his Achilles has inflamed a little bit and we have to put him off impact.\" Asked if April was feasible, Wenger said: \"We have to see now how he responds. He had always a little tendonitis on his Achilles.\"\nCazorla was outstanding until suffering the injury against Norwich in November and, while Arsenal have remained in contention for the Premier League since, they have struggled to recapture the standard of some of their performances in September and October.\nThey face Swansea City tonight, with Wenger yesterday delivering an impassioned defence of his record and telling Arsenal's restless fan base that \"solidarity and togetherness\" can have a huge influence on the most open Premier League title race in recent memory. Arsenal's insipid performance in losing 3-2 to Manchester United on Sunday has been savaged by former players, pundits and fans but Wenger stressed he still enjoys his job as much as ever and argued his team have numerous leaders. There is now a particular question-mark hanging over central midfield, however, with Francis Coquelin, Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Flamini and Mohamed Elneny the remaining options for the foreseeable future.\nWenger added that Wilshere would resume running this week and should then be \"three to four\" weeks away. Oxlade-Chamberlain's comeback has been put at six to eight weeks, meaning both he and Wilshere will miss England friendlies this month against Holland and Germany.\nWenger yesterday urged his players to use all the criticism to inspire improved performances, but claimed that the outside reaction was excessive.\n\"We want to transform the negatives into positives around us and create even more solidarity,\" said Wenger. \"We do not play to be relegated. We are playing to fight for the title. What you want from your fans is to fight together until the last game.\n\"What we have learnt from the league is that it is very tight, that everybody can drop points, and the teams - and the fans - who can show togetherness and solidarity until the end, might come out of it in a positive way.\"\nAsked specifically about Graeme Souness's assertion that Arsenal \"bordered on being a joke\" at United and were \"weak and pussy-footed\", Wenger said: \"I don't want to respond to individual criticism. Part of the opinion is always a bit excessive and emotional, but we have to deal with that and I don't complain.\"\nOf the specific charge that Arsenal lack leaders, Wenger said: \"In a collective psyche you always think you need a saviour when you have a bad result. We have won big games this season with the same players. I don't feel that I lack leaders.\" Asked who his leaders were, Wenger said: \"The team. In every position.\"\nHe also urged perspective. \"Do people think football is only winning, and never losing any more games?\" said Wenger. \"What makes me angry is to lose the game, but my job is to give importance to what is important. You have to focus on what you can influence. We live in a society where the excess is permanent but, when the excess is permanent, it becomes ineffective. You become immune.\n\"Life is not black and white. Life is nuanced. Football is a pleasure. We should not forget that. Football is fantastic as well because it's unpredictable and not mathematical. People forget that we've always been at the top.\n\"What other English club has spent 20 years always in the top four? Can you give me one? No. What do you say then to Man United and Man City this season? It's fantastic what Leicester are doing. Let's fight with them.\""}

Subramaniam, at Kovai Medical Center and Hospital (KMCH) here.\nWhile stent grafting, which involves a tube covered with fabric being placed in aorta through a small incision, is used to treat such aneurysms, KMCH doctors said that such a procedure would not have worked in this case as it would have blocked his stomachs’ blood vessels from connecting to intestines and other organs.\nAddressing a press conference on Monday, Chief of Interventional Radiology Mathew Cherian said the hospital decided to make the holes in the stent themselves, for which the diameter of the connecting blood vessel was calculated using a detailed CT (computed tomography) scan.\nKnown as ‘fenestrated stent grafting,’ this procedure entailed precisely placing small stent grafts inside the main graft stent. Two small holes were made in the main graft stent using a high-precision soldering device by the hospital staff.\nMicro stitching was done around the edges of the two small holes - where the small stents were placed - in the main stent to ensure that the hole did not tear wide open during the procedure or at a later stage. This stitching also made sure that the holes show up in x-ray scans.\nOnce the main stent was placed, the small stents were connected with the branching blood vessel using small tubes inserted into the aorta.\nThe 10-hour “life-saving non surgical repair of abdominal aneurysm” was performed by a team that included Dr. Cherian, vascular surgeon M. Bhuvaneswaran and interventional radiologist Pankaj Mehta.\nDr. Bhuvaneswaran said that performing an open surgery would have taken three days and involved operations in the stomach and heart. Besides, there would have been significant probability of infections at a later stage. In Mr. Subramaniam’s case, he was out of ICU in a day.\nHospital Chairman Nalla G. Palaniswami said that while stents with such holes were available, they alone cost around Rs. 25 lakh and were made mostly in the U.S. The hospital charged Rs. 15 lakh for the entire procedure. He said very few centres in the country have done this procedure.\nRelated Topics"}

Expectations from the Budget include boosting construction and infrastructure, fiscal discipline and supply side de-bottle-necking, Narendra said in an interview with Sumit Sharma.\nAs a banker, do you see early signs of a pickup in growth?\nI definitely see early signs of a pickup in growth. CRISIL expects 6 per cent GDP growth this year compared with 4.7 per cent in FY14. Deficient rains could slow growth to 5.2 per cent. Yet, the expected rain deficit may be counterbalanced by revival in manufacturing sector through domestic de-bottle-necking and export revival.\nWhich sectors could lead the bank’s growth?\nRetail and corporate may lead our growth in the short term. Resumption of stalled projects, rise in mining output and higher external demand will augur well for corporate sector’s growth. Following RBI and government measures, inflation may decrease and higher rabi production will lift rural incomes and support consumption growth.\nWhat’s your wish-list for the Budget?\nGreater fiscal consolidation, deregulation of diesel, removing supply side bottleneck, boosting infrastructure, construction and agriculture and permitting banks to raise capital in long term bonds.\nOver the last three years IOB hired 12,000 people and with it the average age fell to 45 years from 52 years. This year we plan to recruit 6,000 new employees that’ll include CA, MBA, specialists from marketing, legal and agriculture background.\nYour plans to increase use of alternative channels such as ATM, online and mobile?\nWe plan to increase ATMs to 4,000 this fiscal from 2,750 now, and double our debit cards base to 10 million cards.  Our present electronic transaction to total transactions is around 69 per cent and we are planning to achieve 85 per cent this year.\nInflation is unrelenting. When can depositors look forward to higher interest rates?\nNormal monsoon rain is the key to contain inflation. Other factors include crude oil and RBI measures to neutralise overseas inflows and to cool inflationary expectations. The government has to focus on supply side steps. It may take one to two quarters.\nYour plans to increase revenue from overseas branches?\nProfit from our overseas branches this year is expected to grow substantially. Overseas branches contributed 12 per cent to global operating profit. We plan to grow quality assets to increase interest income, fee based income and non-interest income. We plan to add 10-12 more branches overseas in the coming years.\nGross NPAs are almost 5 per cent. How do you plan to bring it down?\nWe are supporting genuine borrowers who suffer losses by hand holding and restructuring. Wilful defaulters are reported to RBI and CIBIL to prevent them from availing loans from others banks. Monitoring top 30 to 50 NPA accounts and review by board level committee of recovery in NPA accounts quickens the recovery process. We expect to bring down gross NPA level to below 4 per cent.\nIOB’s capital raising plan? When could you launch your QIP?\nTo boost our Tier-1 capital adequacy and fund asset expansion we’ll need Rs 3,500 crore capital in FY15. We may raise Rs 1,200 crore in QIP, or preferential bonds or rights. With favorable sentiment, it could be a good time to approach the market by way of QIP after obtaining requisite approvals from government and the Reserve Bank."}

These leads are connected to a pacemaker that delivers continuous stimulation to the brain. The therapy uses an implanted device, similar to pacemaker, to deliver electrical stimulation to precisely target areas of the brain. Stimulation of the se areas enables the brain circuits that control movement to function better,” he explained.\nDr Rupam Borgohainr of the department of neurology said, “For patients not capable of controlling their movements despite various combinations of medications and requiring significant relief due to their work requirement or experiencing serious side-effects of the medication, DBS therapy presents an effective solution.”"}

There was a time when she used to get irritated at the mere mention of “Julie” and what followed. Films like “Sheesha” and “Kya Kool Hain Hum” slotted her as the bombshell for the lowest common denominator. Today, she wilfully discloses that it was she who suggested director Anees Bazmee to name her character Julie. “It is a funny character who lives in delusions. Anees wanted to name it Rosy. I suggested why not Julie. Life has come a full circle for me. Today I can laugh at myself.”\nThe new found confidence has come from films like “Ek Chalis Ki Last Local”, “Mithya” and some “intelligent films” that are in her kitty. “There was a time when I used to fume at critics for being too critical of films like ‘Julie’ and ‘Kya Kool’..., as they were commercially successful. I have realised when they praise ‘Taare Zameen Par’, they have the right to give the devil its due.”\nThe twist\nNeha’s career graph changed the day she found Rajat Kapoor working out on a treadmill next to her in a gym. “He offered me a role. I had just seen his ‘Mixed Doubles’. I asked him his number. He said he doesn’t carry a mobile. I thought he was joking and asked him to give me a call in six weeks. He did and ‘Mithya’ happened. I have already finished two more films with him. One is Saurabh Shukla’s ‘Raat Gayi Baat Gayi’, which is about one night stands and the other is a comedy called ‘I am 24’.” She quickly clarifies that she is not 24. “It is Rajat’s character which is 42 but does everything to prove that he is 24.” The list doesn’t end here she is also working with “heavyweights” like Om Puri, Paresh Rawal and Boman Irani in “Maharathi” and has been signed a few days back for Saurabh’s next venture.\nOne tries to suggest her that this so-called intelligent cinema can also peg you in an image, but Neha says she is conscious about it.\n“As long as there is a character graph, a definite beginning, middle and end and it doesn’t disappear midway, I have no issues.”\nWorking with the likes of Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey and Rajat is considered difficult for they are spontaneous actors who improvise a lot while she has learnt on job. “Yes, I have but I remember what Priyadarshanji once told me during “Chup Chup Ke”. Acting is all about applying common sense.”\nWell, then for roles like Julie does one need to give this sense some rest? “Comedy requires a different approach. Julie wants to become an actress and joins this Punjabi gang from Chandigarh which ran away to Australia. She feels this is the way she will get a break one day. She keeps on delivering dialogues in daily life.

Son of Mohan Veena maestro and India's Grammy Award winner Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, he has received a Pre-Grammy Award nomination which speaks volumes of his highly successful international collaborations. Salil is also the first musician to perform in Parliament of Germany.\nHis flamboyant choice in clothes can make many wonder; his appetite for stage performances might amuse others but when he sits and strings his instrument all are but lost in the mellifluous tunes. Recently he got Sangeet Bhushan award for his contribution to the classical music world. Here he talks about his creation, his legendary father and his award.\nExcerpts from an interview:\nTell us about your creation Satvik veena?\nMy father created Mohan veena approximately half-a-entury ago. My creation is heavily influenced by his and also the Hawaiian guitar. You can say it’s a cross between them. People have this misconception that guitar is a western instrument but it is not so. The oldest string instrument to exist ever was ‘Shat-Tantra Veena’ or a Veena with hundred strings now commonly known as Santoor. From it all other string instruments evolved, be it the Swar Mandal, or my father’s Mohan Veena and for that matter my own Satvik Veena. Every artist should play an instrument which suits his personality; hence I created Satvik Veena almost a couple of decades back.\nWhat is the difference between Mohan Veena and Satvik Veena?\nBoth are different in their structure. Tuning is different. The kind of wood used for creating either of them is different hence the resonance emitted is different too.\nYour father has also been your guru. Please enlighten us about the kind of relation you share with him.\nHaving a Grammy Award winner as my father and guru was a blessing for me but also daunting at times. Though he never pushed me into music, it naturally happened. He never asked me to sit with him and learn but since I guess it’s in our blood I felt guilty at not learning enough and that made me work hard and learn better. He was always supportive but because of all his tours and concerts he never had time. So I literally had to fight against time to get the right directions from him.\nFor a musician what hold more importance: performing and getting firsthand experience on stage or sitting with the guru and doing one’s riyaz?\nRiyaz is a very tiny word to describe what we go through to appear on stage and perform. What we do is a sadhna, a tapasya! I think both the scenarios hold relevance for different people and different situations. Getting solid knowledge from one’s guru is of utmost importance. But now since I have to travel so much for my concerts, I rarely do get time to sit with my father. It’s a part and parcel of a musician’s life. It’s all a part of the ‘sadhana’ we are doing.\nTell us about the recent award you got and how much do these awards mean to an artist?\nI was bestowed with the title of ‘Sangeet Bhushan’ in the 2nd Sangeet Triveni Festival held in New Delhi recently. Vidushi Shanno Khurana ji gave me this award. And I think for me or any artist these awards are a medium of appreciation people show towards us and therefore I accept them with open arms and a bowed head in reverence.\nWhat is the one advice you would want to give aspiring musicians?\nThere is nothing called instant gratification in the world of classical music. Parents come to me after one month and ask when their child will perform on stage! Music should never be learnt with this bent of mind for when we go on stage we aren’t showing off our skills but recreating our thousand-year-old traditions. People are awed by the aplomb when they see us perform but don’t think about the broken backs we’ve had from continuous practice! So what I have to say is learn well, have a solid repertoire, and then maybe think of getting on stage.\nParents come to me after one month and ask when their child will perform on stage!\nRelated Topics"}

To add more value to the input, officials also plan to have neem and pungan leaves in gunny bags dumped into the drum over the input along with the water.\nAfter fermentation for 24 hours, the farm input generated from the drum would be let to the farm using drip irrigation.\nRelated Topics"}

Micro Minions, small action figures, musical ones that make funny sounds and fart blasters (as the name suggests, it makes relevant sounds and is a super hit with the little ones apparently). “The percentage of grown-ups buying Minion toys are higher than kids. Bob and Stuart are popular among the 25 year olds,” says Antony, retail sales executive, Hamleys. And if you want the soft cuddly ones, eBay and Amazon have just that, along with badges, school\/lunch bags, goggles and helmets.\nClothes and accessories\nAt the premiere of Minions , Sandra Bullock walked the red carpet in a pair of yellow, Minion-inspired heels designed by Rupert Sanderson. Too bad we can’t get Sanderson to custom design shoes for us, but what we can do is grab a pair of those shoes on selfridges.com. The store and the website also stock a special line created by designers Giles Deacon, Piers Atkinson and Sanderson. Titled the Bello Yellow Collection, it has sequined outfits, silk dresses, sweatshirts, head gears, denim shirts and T-shirts.\nFor matching footwear, there are designers and artists who hand-paint shoes, like Shailee’s Custom Painted Shoes and Tees, a page on Facebook, which specialises in Minion-themed canvas footwear. Apart from sneakers and slip ons, Fashionara.com has nude pumps with Minions in different avatars on them.\nPrinted T-shirts are perhaps the simplest way to wear your Minion on your sleeve. Or you can team up a blue dungaree with a yellow top just like your favourite unicellular beings. Hoodies, suspenders, hats, hair bands, baby shoes, woollen socks, cushioned flip flops and beanies are the other preferred themed accessories. And for fans of spoofs, ultykhopdi.com has T-shirts with Gabbar, Wolverine, the gang from Big Bang Theory — all Minion-fied.\nNails\nPinterest is buzzing with thousands of nail art pictures inspired by the Minions. Wouldn’t you want that cheerful yellow with faces of one or two-eyed characters on your nails? Just looking at them can brighten your day. If you can’t get salons to do it for you, YouTube has a few tutorial videos that demonstrate how to get it right. Or the easier way out would be to invest in nail stickers which are available on online portals like Aliexpress.com.\nParties\nTheme parties are fun. But sometimes, coming up with an idea that has a universal appeal can be a task. Minions seem to have takers across all age groups. Right from Halloween costumes to birthday outfits, people love experimenting with this theme.\nVandana Mahtani of Lloyd’s Tea House says, “We receive quite a few orders for Minion cakes and cupcakes. In the last two months, we have catered to around 16 such orders for cupcakes alone.” The latest party that she catered to had a dessert table full of goodies inspired by the movie. Cookies, mousse, macaroons and cake pops were part of the menu and all stuck to the blue and yellow colour scheme.\nMinion Yellow is described by Pantone as the “colour of hope, joy and optimism.”\nRelated Topics"}

Pradeep Chakravarthy\nSix years to translate 100 poems — each of four lines — seems like an inordinate time even for an academic. But Archana Venkatesan’s translation of Nammalvar’s Tiruviruttam is time well spent. The 255-page slender volume is a must-have for lovers of Tamil Vaishnavite literature and, in general, lovers of metaphor-laden love poems.\nAmong the 12 Vaishnavite saints who sang in Tamil during the Bhakti movement, Nammalvar of Alwar Tirunagari is a favourite for many. His chosen metre was the andadi , in which the last word of the stanza is also the first of the next. Nammalvar is said to have lived in the ninth century and, by the time of Tirumangai Alvar, his verses had achieved religious sanction as integral parts of temple ritual.\nHis verse continues to excite devotees and lovers of literature alike for many reasons. First, it’s the rhyme and rhythm in his words; second, the superbly terse, succinct use of those words. Not one word is out of place, each contributing to creating a vision of Narayana as all-pervading, generous, and willing to enter into the devotee’s heart and take him to his abode.\nThough the 100 verses of Tiruviruttam are linked to each other by words and a general meaning, they are independent poems speaking of the heroine’s yearning for her hero, Tirumal or Narayana.\nFor Vaishnava scholars, the love poems are anyapadesa or an outer coat that protects the svapadesa , the esoteric import that speaks of the soul’s yearning to unite with the supreme. The Tiruviruttam needs to be read carefully to be understood. For this purpose alone, the book is an absolute essential in a world where the pain of separation from a loved one is still real. None of the poems offer a solution but reminds us that those who master the verses “won’t ever be trapped in the quicksand of delusory birth, its wicked fate, the misery of this false world.”\nThe book also has Periyavachan Pillai’s commentary on the text for six selected verses (one for each of the characters), indexes of characters, motifs, myths, places (though Udayagiri strikes a discordant note as the Tamil text doesn’t mention it as specifically) and names that can help those searching the text to get information quickly. It is a relief to see the tulasi referred to as tulay ( thuzhai would have been better), the Tamil word, rather than basil, which is the wrong plant altogether!\nHere are a couple of examples of the translation: Little worms that live in a wound\/ Do what they do.\/ What do they know of the world?\/ I learned these songs from the cunning Tirumal\/ Who uses me to sing of himself.\/ It’s like people making meaning\/ From the chirp of a lizard. (Verse 48)\nShe said –\/ Like a monkey tossing aside a ruby\/ Evening falls\/ Casting aside the golden sun\/ O precious gem who measured worlds\/ My beloved emerald\/ Golden one who has no equal\/ You’re the sole refuge of your servant’s life.\nThe book brings this complex work to a larger audience. One hopes that dancers and other performers will seek to interpret these metaphors and love imagery using this book. One also hopes that, as the author completes her translation of Nammalvar’s Thiruvaimozhi, she also does the Peria Tiru Antati and thus complete all the works of this poet saint par-excellence.\nRelated Topics"}

He wanted the court to direct the CBI to register FIRs against them for their complicity.\nJustice NRL Nageswara Rao of the High Court said in his order on the criminal petition (No. 13993 of 2011) that the private complaint had been rightly rejected by the lower court. The petitioner filed a complaint before the CBI special judge to take cognizance of the offences against some of the ministers and also secretaries of the government. His contention was that all these people have abused their power and committed acts of irregularities. The reason for this complaint to be initiated is the fact that in the public interest litigation in WP No.794 of 2011 and connected batch, the High Court ordered investigation into some of the allegations alleged in that complaint. It is not in dispute the CBI to inquire into the particulars of the allegations and it is not in dispute that the investigation is still in progress. Besides, the private complaint is filed against the respondents on the ground that they have committed corrupt practices by using their position and this fact is linked with the investigation ordered by the Division Bench to be conducted by the CBI.\nTherefore, there cannot be any parallel enquiry to be taken up by the CBI Court. If there are any deficiencies in the CBI’s investigation, which wanted to be projected in the complaint, he can approach the division bench on the above PIL for necessary directions. But, however, the presentation of this complaint is not warranted and it being premature and the allegations there being not established by any evidence supported by the complainant.\nSection 210 of the CrPC has no application and the complaint had been rightly rejected by the lower court, the judge observed."}

For heroines, the most crucial one is the Lux test. The moment a heroine gets an opportunity to promote the soap brand, we get a feeling that she is on the highway to marquee. The latest to join the illustrious list is Asin.\nComing from a family of academics, Asin says she never thought she would be in a field where beauty will be crucial to her success. “I believe in innate beauty because if you are beautiful from inside, it reflects on your face.” Going down memory lane, Asin says while being good at studies she was active in extra-curricular activities. “One of the activities happened to be modelling. The offer came in class 10 and happened to be a catalyst.” Those who have a way with books are generally considered lazy in taking care of their body but Asin happens to be an exception.\nAfter the initial buzz surrounding her first Bollywood flick, Ghajini, Asin doesn't seem to have got the kind of exposure she got down South. Asin obviously differs and says she is quite satisfied with her short innings in Bollywood and has some plum projects.\n“I am also working on a Tamil film Kaavalan.” Generally once an actor successfully crosses the Vindhyas, she doesn't look back to the home turf.\n“No, I have no fixed agenda. If I get a good offer I am open to simultaneously working in both the industries. I don't look at films from the regional point of view. I have a pan-India presence and perhaps that's the reason Lux has chosen me.”\nAs for Hindi, she is again working in a remake called Ready. This time it is the remake of a Telugu hit of the same name. Directed by Anees Bazmi, Asin stars opposite Salman Khan, who is proving to be her benefactor post London Dreams. “I believe if my work is good I will be noticed. For that I don't need to go to parties or make news for reasons that don't emanate from my work.”\nANUJ KUMAR"}

Her struggle for a job despite her disability has earned her a great deal of respect from many of her friends. They also note: “Her husband did not marry her for the assistance. He takes her everywhere.”\nFor many other visually challenged women, trusting the spouse, siblings and society is getting increasingly difficult. “I get plenty of cases of women abandoned by their husbands. Even for many families, a visually challenged girl is a liability who needs to be married off as soon as possible. There is very little focus on education,” said N.S. Venkataraman, trustee, Nandini Voice for the Deprived, at a discussion recently.\nThe cases of men leaving their wives gain more significance in the context of the State government's scheme under which Rs.20,000 is given to the person without any disability who marries a visually challenged person. “There are many broken marriages like that, which need to be looked into,” added Mr. Venkataraman.\n“Instead of allowance, one of them can be given job in government according to the merit. This will ensure that such marriages remain stable,” suggested a participant.\nIt was pouring, but that did not deter the 22 women with visual disability from far-flung areas such as Avadi, Tiruvallur and Maduravoyal from making it to the meeting, which, as one of the participants described it, was one of the few where they get to speak about their problems. Banks, said most of the women, are where they faced many problems. “Nationalised banks have very considerate rules, but they are not being implemented,” said T. Meenakshi, a school teacher. “Bank managers insist that someone accompany us all the time,” she said.\nAvailing oneself of loans for starting entrepreneurial activity is always a Herculean task, but even procuring an ATM card is difficult. Many banks have not installed mandatory talking ATMs and so they deny us the card facility, she said. “The situation worsens when the bank managers refuse to meet us and insist that we should talk to clerical staff, who, in turn, say that they do not have the necessary authority,” she added.\n“We do not want sympathy. We want only understanding and a place to live with dignity,” said the women. Denial of hostel rooms has increased travel time for many of these women. This has increased the possibility of instances of molestation. “Many women face it every day, in buses, on streets, but they do not talk about it because they are never heard,” said Mr. Venkataraman.\n“Even the Disability Advisory Committee has only male representatives. ,” said Parameswari, a student of Ethiraj College for Women.\nShortage of Braille books in schools and colleges, reluctance of the private sector to employ persons with disability and need for procedural transparency in the filling of government jobs were highlighted by these women. “The announcements in railway and bus stations are made only a few minutes before the arrival or the departure of the train or bus. A guidance counter for visually challenged persons will be of great help,” said Ms.Parameswari.\n“It is the general lack of respect for us in the society that concerns us the most,” said Shyamala, a student of Quaid-E-Millath Government College for Women.\nAfter the debate, as the women waded through the flooded streets of Besant Nagar, gesturing at every passing car to stop, it was the indifference of those around that stood out the most. “Very few help, especially when we need it the most,” said Ms. Shyamala.\nRelated Topics"}

Roja, accompanied by YSRC MLAs Ch Bhaskar Reddy, Narayanaswamy, Amarnatha Reddy and Sunil, came to Nagari on Saturday and staged a dharna in front of the police station seeking action against those involved in attacking her.\nAs per details, when Roja was about to perform the ‘first Harati’ to Goddess Gangamma on Friday mid-night, some miscreants in the crowd snatched the ‘harathi plate’ from her hands, injuring her wrist in the process. Then, Roja, along with other YSRC leaders and activists, immediately staged a dharna at the temple itself until the early hours of Saturday seeking action against those involved in the incident. Alleging that Village Revenue Officer (VRO) Jyoti Reddy and Babu Reddy, an accused in the red sanders case, were behind the attack, she wanted the police to take immediate action against them.  Meanwhile, on Saturday morning, after learning about the incident, YSRC MLAs from the district rushed to Nagari and staged a protest outside the police station demanding the suspension of the Puttur DSP Krishna Kishore as he was acting as per the diktats of TDP leaders.\nThe MLAs, along with a large number of party supporters, raised slogans against the government and condemned the attack on the woman MLA.

The district presently supply ten percent of the total milk supplied through co-operative societies in the State.\nThe district has third position in milk production with Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram in first and second places, respectively.

A recent survey had revealed that only those aged above 40 were involved in dairy farming as it had became less profitable due to high prices of fodder and low remuneration.

Unable to make any impact, he finally flings a chair at the gunman,” she said.\nIn this context, Jayalalithaa claimed credit for modernisation of the police force throughout the country. She said that when she became chief minister for the first time in 1991, the State police did not have weaponry to combat militancy and terrorism. “Our policemen carried muskets and .303 rifles of Second World War vintage. On the other hand, the militants possessed ultra-modern, sophisticated fire-arms for which our police had no answer.”\nIt was her pioneering efforts, which resulted in the implementation of the Modernisation of Police Force (MPF) Scheme in all states with Central assistance, she asserted.\nHighlighting the importance of handling the weapons effectively, she said firing had to be precise and accurate so that the terrorist was either gunned down or overpowered, leaving innocent people unharmed. “It is in this context that this competition assumes importance.”\nPointing out that the competition was not a mere sporting event, where the “tussle was for medals and trophies and personal glory”, the chief minister said it was “a preparation to equip the police to face hard reality when confronted with terrorism”.\nSince firing range drills would help nurture shooting skills, she said she ordered the setting up of a firing range at Othivakkam in 2002 by transferring 221.95 acres of land, where the present competition was held.\nThe chief minister said she also proposed to sanction funds for purchase of special firearms like rifles or pistols of .177 or .22 bore, so that the state police could participate in another event, All India Police Sports Shooting Championship, which was held on the pattern of Olympic shooting games."}

The total voter registration for Delhi stands at approximately 1.19 crore.\n“The young have broken all stereotypes. They want to vote. They make up more than three per cent of the total voter registrations. There is a rule that only those people who are 18 as on January 1, 2013, are eligible to vote. All those turning 18 after that cannot be given voters identity cards. There are around 2.6 lakh who fall in this category,” said Mr. Dev, adding that there were about 1.18 crore registrations in October 2012, out of which only 93,811 were between the ages of 18 and 19.\n“In a year, the registration increased from 0.79 per cent to 3.4 per cent, which is a significant jump,” he said, before explaining the methodology that his office had taken to identify and bring the young on board.\n“We first contacted the Directorate of Education and identified that everyone between the ages of 18 to 19 years were either in Class XII or first year of college. Our team went to each of these schools and colleges and contacted the Headmaster or Principal. Applications for voters’ cards were handed out and collected at their schools and colleges, and we even sent them the cards. None of them even needed to make the trip to the local election office,” he said, adding that the response of the youth had even taken them by surprise. “I give 100 per cent marks to the youth in terms of voter awareness and duty. And, for those young people who are not fortunate enough to be enrolled anywhere, we have taken out special camps in certain areas where there are unauthorised colonies, construction workers and manual labourers,” he added, while revealing that his office had more activities planned to rope in the young.\n“There will be more celebrities, concerts and even flash mobs extolling the young to come out and vote. Known faces that appeal to young people will be asked to come and talk or perform in certain areas. We will target areas like university campuses as well as those areas which we have identified as low registration areas.”\nRelated Topics"}

There's the obvious difficulty, ensuring voter safety; and whether the ruling party will be able to ensure smooth governance after the conflict ends or whether the elections themselves can aid in state-building, curtailing the length of the conflict itself.\nLook cursorily at the polls just a month ago and Karzai's victory would have seemed inevitable. He enjoyed more airtime and coverage than his rivals: Dr Abdullah Abdullah, who prefers to be known as just Abdullah, a former challenger to the presidency and now a force to be reckoned with; and Ashraf Ghani, the soft-spoken World Bank type who traded in his Zegna suit for a cool fez and has Bill Clinton's campaign manager running his campaign. But Karzai has the obvious power of incumbency and is an ethnic Pashtun who has created a consortium of crafty alliances with dubious warlords. But the question is being asked in this campaign: are these alliances detrimental to the people of Afghanistan?\nSimply put, no. Obviously allowing armed warlords to conduct a thriving drug trade is problematic but Karzai has managed a unity that seemed impossible five years ago. Take the simple case of warlord Rashid Dostum. He ran in the first elections, he commands a five thousand-man army, possesses the capacity to shake up the ethnic Uzbek vote  but now he sides with Karzai. That's clearly not enough though: Karzai needs to indicate that he is willing to curtail the warlords' mounting excesses, or the allegation that he has ceded de facto power to a bunch of no-good thugs will gain strength.\nThat, couched as concern about \"high levels of corruption\" is the main criticism heard of Karzai. But what would his opponents do in order to prevent warlords from running amuck? Disband them? How to do that without breeding more chaos?"}

But, the issue of plagiarism within its own ranks has not been taken seriously enough.\nIn the last few months, allegations of copyrights violations of scripts and plagiarism from foreign movies that have surfaced in Tamil cinema have exposed the extent to which the industry lags behind on two important issues: lack of awareness, and proper institutional mechanisms to deal with copyright infringement.\nAfter filmmaker A.R. Murugadoss landed in a controversy over alleged intellectual theft, the Tamil Nadu Film Director’s Union announced that its members could register their scripts with the union itself, providing a partial solution to the problem.\nIn what could well be a game changer, producer Elred Kumar has said that he is thinking of serving a legal notice on acclaimed cinematographer and filmmaker Ravi K. Chandran. His charge is that the director plagiarised substantial portions of the 1978 film Midnight Express for his first feature Yaan , which was produced by Mr. Kumar’s production house, R.S. Infotainment Pvt. Ltd.\n“Why must I be responsible if Columbia Pictures decides to sue my production house? This is clearly a breach of the undertaking that he signed saying that Yaan is his original work. Not just scenes, even characters have been lifted right out of Midnight Express . He must take responsibility,” said Mr. Kumar.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Chandran maintained that Yaan ’s story had nothing to do with Midnight Express .\nLegal experts agree that this case, if taken to its logical conclusion in the courts, could set a precedent. Lawyers dealing with copyright infringement disputes say that unless the duration taken to resolve cases is reduced, the situation will not significantly change.\n“In India, the aggrieved party goes to court only as a way to put pressure on the other party into paying some sort of compensation. Rarely do cases reach the stage of judgements. These cases have to be resolved on a time-bound basis,” said M.V. Swaroop, a lawyer who has appeared in several copyright disputes.\nThis is also one of the reasons why Hollywood movie studios rarely sue Indian filmmakers and production houses for copyright infringement, he added.\nWhile R.K. Selvamani, secretary of the union, said members have been “instructed” not to plagiarise from foreign movies, there are, however, no clear consequences for those who violate rules. “In the world of internet, it is easy to find out from where the content has been lifted. If the original copyright owner approaches us, we will support them and take action,” he said.\nRelated Topics"}

Its leaders say they are hopeful of opening the party's account from Kasargode district.\nThe best BJP showing in Kerala thus far has been from two constituencies in Kasargode where it came runners up in three elections.\nMuralidhar Rao, the BJP national secretary and party in-charge for Kerala, says things will be different this time.\n\"The BJP leadership has taken the electoral battle very seriously. We will open our account in the Kerala assembly,\" Rao told IANS.\nHe said Sushma Swaraj, who is also leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, will stay put and lead the campaign in the state which has till now been divided between the two fronts led by the Congress and Marxists.\nOther BJP national leaders will also campaign in the state.\nThe first list of candidates is expected to be announced Friday. It would include the big names from the state, including former central minister O. Rajagopal, former state president P.K. Krishna Das, C.K. Padmanabhan and K. Surendran.\n\"This time there is going to be more than one lotus which will bloom in the state,\" Rao said.\n\"A lot of factors are in our favour. Our performance in the October local bodies poll is our strength,\" said Krishna Das.\nKrishna Das has already started the first round of campaign at Kattakada in rural Thiruvananthapuram.\nIn the October local bodies polls, the BJP almost doubled the number of seats, from 550 in 2005 to more than 970 seats. It also came second in more than 1,000 seats.\n\"Gone are the days when the media used to depict us as a party which sells its votes,\" added Surendran, who has begun a door-to-door campaign at Manjesweram in Kasargode.\nBJP's vote share in the 2006 assembly elections was six percent. This rose to 10 percent in the May 2009 Lok Sabha election, and to 12 percent in the October 2010 local bodies polls.\nBJP's best hopes lie in Manjesweram and Kasargode constituencies - both in Kasargode district - where it took the second slot in the past three assembly polls.\nThe party also enjoys a strong presence in Nemom and Kattakada in the capital district.\nRajagopal's candidature has been unofficially announced. He is set to be fielded from Nemom. In 2006, he finished third but with a healthy 25,000 - plus votes from Palakkad.\n\"Why we are confident is because the two fronts here have failed. When it comes to corruption, they are like two sides of a coin,\" said Surendran, referring to the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the ruling Left Democratic Front.\n\"The biggest casualty this time is the CPI-M. The vote banks of the CPI-M and the BJP are the same. We will make inroads into this vote bank, and the lotus will bloom for certain,\" said Surendran."}

The woman was reportedly planning to move out with her sons when Singh killed the boys and left her almost dead.\nIn the disturbing tape, played in New Westminster Supreme Court, 15-year-old Ranjit Gill is heard crying out to his mother before he is shot dead by his stepfather.\nBefore the crime, Singh is heard making some remarks in Punjabi and walking around the house for some time.\nThen he is heard pulling the trigger and shooting dead his sleeping elder stepson Amarjit Gill.\nNext, screams and cries for help are heard as the man rushes into the bedroom of his younger stepson Ranjit and shoots him too even as the boy cries out: \"Mommy, mommy.\"\nAfter killing his two stepsons, Singh is heard turning on his wife, with the butt of his rifle hitting her on the head while the woman pleads with him to spare her life.\nThe beating lasts about 20 to 25 minutes. After she falls unconscious, the man is heard saying in English, \"That's it.\"\nThen it is all quiet for some time, with only Singh's heavy breathing being audible on the tape. The lull is broken as his battered wife starts sobbing and moaning.\nAfter beating her unconscious, prosecution lawyer Don Wilson said, Singh called 911 (police). And then he again turned to his wife and tried to slit her throat with a knife.\nShockingly, the murderer could be seen smiling and laughing Friday when the prosecution lawyer narrated the difficulties in their marriage.\nSukhwinder was not in the court, but the defence lawyer played an 11-minute video of her impact statement.\n\"They (the sons) were my entire life...my whole reason for living has been snatched away...Instead of the family growing, I am reduced to a lone person,\" she sobbed in her victim impact statement.\nShe showed deep scars of beating on head and arm, adding that she cannot eat solid food as it gets stuck in her throat because of the slitting she suffered.\nSingh faces life behind bars, with no possibility of parole for 20 years."}

Nevertheless, even Gutenberg would not have imagined the scales to which e-books have transformed the world of reading. Technology has changed the dynamics of our interactions in several ways. New forays into digital efficacy is changing the literary landscape for sure.  Well, for better or for worse? This argument would invariably bring in the question of business models, pricing and economics of e-books which is another matter altogether. Another facet of the debate that is equally pertinent and needs to be explored is the experience of book reading. “I want an e-book reader as I just cannot read heavy prose on my system without getting a headache,” says Ananya Shekhar, a college student to whom not just the content but the experience of reading also matters. However, Preeti Sahu, a housewife disagrees.\n“I love the tactile sensation of holding a book in your hands, you know,” she says adding, “I sometimes feel they (e-books) do not have a character or presence. They are soulless.”\nSome however feel the introduction of new multimedia books that use enhanced features such as video integrated with text like the iPad is taking the experience of reading to a whole new level. “Why can’t both the mediums co-exist happily? My guess is that  print books will not become extinct but might have a reduced role,” says Venkatesh Achauri, a humanities student. Venkatesh however feels e-books have an edge over print as they take up virtually no room in a physical sense and are both super-portable and searchable. “It saves lots of time because it is easier to find words or phrases in an e-book. Else, you are always on a wild goose chase for a particular passage or a quote,” he adds.\nThere is also a view that just like MP3S dominating the music industry, e-books are here to stay and might even make print books obsolete. “What is the fuss about? When quality does not suffer, how does it matter?,” asks Vinod Raman Kumar, a technical analyst. Meanwhile, e-book developers are working on  student-friendly features such as highlighting and note-taking  to make the experience of reading as ‘real’ as possible.\nWill e-books supercede or only supplement print remains to be seen. As the debate rages on, certain things however never change. “They (e-books and print) are not much different. You still have to read, no matter what, “ says Akhila Kumari, who studies in Standard VI."}

Pinto\n| Jul 19, 2001, 22:29 IST\nmangalore: ``in other nations, a bribe is taken to go beyond one's call of duty. in our country, they take bribes as part of their salary.'' an old protagonist says in tamil blockbuster indian, while killing a doctor, obviously for taking bribe. chief vigilance commissioner n. vittal recently remarked: ``corruption is a high-profit, low-risk activity.'' corruption goes on in most government departments, but tipping scales seems to be the rto. at mangalore rto, the `modus operandi' to drive an applicant to a tout is simple. if the applicant comes on his own, he will have to go in circles at least a week. in between, if he meets one of the 150 touts, his work is done in a jiffy. touts have such a stranglehold on the rto that a person at the self-help kiosk set up by lions club of mangaladevi -- to circumvent corruption -- was assaulted by the rto officials. the man at the kiosk, abdul latif, claimed he was dragged to a police station on the pretext that he was creating a nuisance at the rto office. latif claims whenever a tout approaches the clerk, a wide grin would welcome him and the drawer would open. the tout drops in the required `money' and takes the change. forms get signed and processed immediately. latif said when he approaches the clerks, they point out some non-existent errors and harass him. sources said a tout has made so much money that he is one of the richest in the city. now, he has roped in his relatives. rto officials get away with this kind of blatant corruption as touts act as middlemen. rates vary for each job and difference between actuals and the final fee (through a tout) is at least 100-200 per cent more. a reliable source said an inspector must pay anywhere between rs 3-5 lakh to get the job. while 50 per cent of the `speed money' gets distributed among officials, the rest goes to the higher-ups, including the minister's party fund, his expenses during his stay in the city, plus the air fare. the source says if the minister does not get a royal treatment, the official is transferred to a less lucrative area. according to rto officials, bijapur is the most sought after posting. incidentally, herold d'souza, president of lions club, mangaladevi, who was instrumental in setting up the kiosk near rto, says: ``when i approached the transport minister at bangalore with the kiosk idea, he had ridiculed me saying i was trying to swim against the tide.'' on the `manhandling' of latif, manjunathaiah, rto, said as he misbehaved and abused rto personnel he dragged him out and handed him over to the police. in the name of service, lions club president is also into this business, he alleged. while the two- and four-wheeler licences were done as per the rto-prescribed fee, the booth personnel were making profit during the transfer of permits, particularly for autorickshaws, he stated. on corruption in the department, he expressed helplessness saying it was difficult for one person to prevent it. he claimed that after he assumed office, corruption had come down by 50 per cent. besides, he said unless the treasury - which is inside the rto area - is shifted, he can't prevent touts from entering the premises. the matter, however, has been taken up with the higher authorities. he has requested the public to approach the officers concerned directly and get their work done. in case of any problems, they could approach him."}

Balagopal Memorial Lecture here on Sunday. Mr. Khalid who called himself an anti-national, branded so by the media, said students’ movements posed the biggest threat to Hindutva forces and an attack on campuses after BJP ascended to power was expected. “When they went after Rohith Vemula they were not attacking a person. They were attacking a student leader and a fighter. They were also attacking Ambedkarite politics,” he said adding the BJP government tried to disrupt ‘justice for Rohith Vemula movement’ by cracking down on JNU students, including himself who supported Kashmir’s right to self determination.\nNew solidarities\nMr. Khalid said the slogan ‘Jai Bhim, Lal Salam’ that developed out of larger solidarities between students brings a ray of hope of meeting of two ideologies. The question of caste and the question of patriarchy are very important questions of times and these questions are internal to revolutionary transformation, Mr. Khalid, who holds a radical Left world-view, said.\nChallenging the government who ‘tried to rein-in students’, Mr. Khalid said: “They wanted to teach us a lesson. But we haven’t learnt that lesson. We will continue to uphold our political views.” Remembering Mr. Balagopal, who was a renowned lawyer, writer and activist, had helped contextualise political movements of his times, Mr. Khalid said “You could either agree or disagree with him but you could never have ignored him.” Human Rights Forum organised the meet to commemorate the seventh death anniversary of Mr. Balagopal.\nStruggle for rights\nOther speakers in the meet included member Communist Party of India’s National Council and president of Adivasi Mahasabha Manish Kunjam, faculty member in University of Hyderabad K. Y. Ratnam and Zameer Ahmed of Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society.\nMr. Kunjam, who has been working in conflict-affected Bastar of Chhattisgarh, said the condition of Adivasis in Bastar is as bad as Kashmiris. From media blackout to targeting leaders, Bastar police has tried every possible way to suppress people’s movements for rights. Prof. Ratnam, who was one of the faculty members who got arrested during the unrest in UoH on March 22, rejected Justice Roopanwal Commission report that declared Rohith Vemula non-Dalit.\nRelated Topics"}

Pronto Pronto (Srinath) it was which won the Bangalore Derby eventually. There was no disputing the potential of the first four finishers too. But whatever happened to the rest of them one wondered.\nWhile the first four placed horses Pronto Pronto, Seversthal (A. Imran Khan), Romantique (Neeraj Rawal) and the favourite Lovely Kiss (Suraj Narredu) battled for the order of placings in the final 100 metres or so, the others simply plodded along far behind and were among the beaten brigade a long way from home.\nWhatever happened to the excellent track work that the entrants clocked in preparations for the Derby? How did they all lose their known form so soon and pronto? Or did they just make up the numbers? Or worse still, was it just a matter of arriving at pre-determined positions for the 13 which placed behind the top four, were never even in the hunt for the best part of the trip. All talk of ability in terms of pedigree and form was rendered futile by the manner in which most of the horses performed.\nIn any case, the show went on. Another large 20,000 crowd turned up ‘to see and to be seen’, to borrow the late racing commentator Harish’s phrase. They saw, they were seen and then went home pronto, pronto.\nThe now popular, and expected, huge roar rent the air as the starter despatched the field for the `2.36 crore stake money offering Derby run over 2,000 metres. African Queen hit the front and was chased by Magnitude, Super Duper, Preordained, Lad King, Lovely Kiss, Romantique, Forever Glory, Tiberius, Seversthal, Star Marquess, Pronto Pronto, Vijaykeerthi, Saratoga Spring, Nearness Of You, Silver Springs and At The Helm at the back of the field.\nPassing the mile marker, African Queen shot her bolt already and began to back pedal. Magnitude then took charge with Preordained close behind. Lovely Kiss too moved up with Super Duper dropping back too. As they took the rising ground and came into view in the short, 400-metres straight, Preordained was prominent and surged ahead with Seversthal breathing down his neck. Past the distance post, Seversthal charged ahead and opened a two-length lead even as Lovely Kiss moved up five wide. In the meanwhile, Pronto Pronto took the shortest way home and challenged Seversthal. The latter was not exactly ridden out by the A. Imran Khan. It was evident that the Imtiaz Sait ward Pronto Pronto would catch and pass him. That’s what exactly happened and Pronto Pronto managed to spare a long neck at the wire even as Srinath waved his stick in the air in delight and let out a victory roar himself. Stablemate Romantique managed to finish third ahead of Lovely Kiss with the rest of the field not sighted at all.\nThe victory was doubly sweet for Mumbai-based trainer Imtiaz Sait for this was his first Derby success for him at a centre where he was part of the staff long ago.\n“After his victory in the Colts, I knew he had the potential to win. Srinath had partnered him then too. With Srinath again doing duty, I knew he would overcome the fact that he was drawn 18. And like Aboline did in 2009, would come and win. All credit to the jockey for settling him well and then timing his final charge to a nicety and to the horse for responding equally well,” said a modest Imtiaz.\nThe joint owners of Pronto Pronto, Pallon S Mistry representing Manjri Horse Breeders Farm and DR Thacker took home the winners’ purse of `1.42 crore."}

Will ‘Sivaji,’ starring Rajnikanth, prove to be yet another feather in his cap?\nRight from his debut film, ‘Gentleman,’ the creations churned out by director Shankar’s dream factory are meant to storm box-offices as they are entertainment extravaganzas that appeal to the masses. His movies are commercial masalas, with larger than life characters and a message-oriented, sugar-coated story.\nShankar makes expensive films and uses state-of-the-art techniques that appeal to the youth. All this has made him the ‘baron’ of the box-office, as he has never tasted failure. Now the spotlight is on Shankar once again as he is teamed up with the superstar of the industry, Rajnikanth.\nHigh expectations\nSitting in his aesthetically done up new office in T.Nagar, Chennai, Shankar says: “A lot is riding on ‘Sivaji,’ as it is my first film with superstar Rajnikanth. The expectations are high, because the audience expects a certain kind of film from us. We decided to take a middle path — the story has to move forward keeping the star’s image in mind.”\nFor Shankar it was the biggest challenge in his life, as the mix had to be right. Says Shankar: “ ‘Sivaji’ is basically a very simple story about a man who wants to do something good for the society, which is steeped in corruption. Our man cleans the system in his own way. There is also a very relevant message.”\nThe director says that his films are issue-related fantasies and in ‘Sivaji’ he has packaged it with all ingredients that one associates with a Rajnikanth masala entertainer — punch lines, comedy, romance, dream songs, huge sets, sentiment, powerful villain, fights and finally good triumphing over evil.\nAdds Shankar: “We cannot ignore the image of Rajnikanth and do a film with him. ‘Sivaji’ Sivaji is a well-balanced concoction of this image, heroism and the narration. In fact during the dubbing of the film, Rajni used to say that it is going to be a super hit and AVM Saravanan, the producer after seeing the final copy, told me that they are very happy with it.”\nThe highlight of any Shankar film is the music and the picturisation of songs.\nIn fact the ‘mind-blowing’ song sequences and the breathtaking sets were so impressive that Abirami Ramanathan paid a whopping Rs 6.5 crores for the Chennai city rights.\nShankar says that he and Rahman sat together for days working out the tunes.\nAdds Shankar: “There are five songs in the film and all of them have turned out to be chartbusters. I think our combination ( Rahman-Shankar-Rajnikanth) has clicked as I’m told that the combined sales of ‘Sivaji’ albums in Tamil and Telugu have created a new all India record, even before the release of the film!.”\nThe talkie portion of the film took only 65 days to shoot, while the songs and fight scenes were choreographed in about 160 days!\nShankar is all praise for his team of actors such as Shriya, Suman and Vivek and technicians, cinematographer K.V.Anand, art director Thotta Tharani, editor Antony, action choreographer Peter Haynes and costume designer Manish Malhotra.\nSays Prabhu Deva, who has choreographed the hit number ‘Style…’ in the film: “We shot the song against the backdrop of Spain’s great architectural wonders, something nobody has done before. I made Rajni and Shriya do difficult steps and the whole song has been enriched by some awesome computer graphics. People are going to go crazy about it.”\nShankar signs off by saying: “A lot of hard work straight from the heart has gone into ‘Sivaji.’ There will be a repeat audience for the film which has no blood or gore in it, it is a family entertainer for which the censors has given me a clean ‘U’ certificate.

The government has decided to establish a health university in Warangal. It was the government’s endeavour to provide quality medical education to the students of Telangana. Students used to go to Vijayawada for various medical courses, but with the establishment of a health university in Warangal, medical students would be benefited within the state, he said. Rajaiah, who is also holding medical and health portfolio, said the TRS government issued orders for establishing a university for health sciences in the state, which is named as Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences, in Warangal. The government has sanctioned Rs 5 crore for this purpose and an office was also set up, he said. Answering to a question raised by Karne Prabhakar and Bodakunti Venkateshwarlu, Rajaiah said there are 20 medical colleges in Telangana state--five government colleges, three minority institutions and 12 non-minority colleges--with total 2,950 MBBS seats.\nOn the issue of establishing a body on the lines of All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Telangana, the minister said that government has written to the Centre in this regard. As sought by them, the government has identified 200 acres of land and sent the proposal to the Union ministery of health for necessary action. A final decision has to be taken by the Centre, he added.\nRajaiah said no dengue death is reported in Telangana after TRS government came to power. Though 505 dengue cases were reported, there was no instance of death, he said in Legislative Council. The government is determined to strengthen Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and improve medical facilities in tribal areas in the state, he said, adding that it has been decided to fill all vacancies of doctor, para medical staff, pharmacist, staff nurse and lab technician to provide quality medical services to Girijans. He said it was proposed in 2014-15 budget to upgrade Khammam district hospital at a cost of Rs 10 crore. The government also sanctioned upgradation of Bhadrachalam area hospital from 100 beds to 200 beds at a cost of Rs 18.14 crore under Nabard. Rajaiah said it is under consideration to establish a 30-bed CHC at Medaram, where Samakka Sarakka jatra is held every two years. Also, the PHC at Pasara is also under consideration for upgradation as a 30-bed hospital. Upgradation of PHCs at Bazar Hatnoor, Narnoor and Khanaapur in Adilabad district has been taken up. Similarly, PHCs of Tiryani and Jainoor were also upgraded to 30-bed hospitals and creation of infrastructure is in process. The deputy CM said upgradation of Amrabad and Baimoor PHCs is under consideration.\nThe State Government proposes to introduce “Telangana State Song” in all government schools, minister for education Jagdeeshwar Reddy said.\nReplying to a question raised by P Sudhakar Reddy, the minister said a song is under consideration of the state government and appropriate orders will be issued in due course.\nThe government has proposed to develop Rachakonda Fort and the surrounding areas as a tourist destination with Central financial assistance.\nThis was prioritised by the ministry of tourism for sanction during 2014-15 and a detailed project report with a total outlay of `8.74 crore was submitted to the Central Government. The works will be taken up after the funds are released by the Centre."}

For instance, he ordered that no Hindu should ride a palanquin, an Arab horse or an elephant without permission. However, Aurangzeb was shrewd enough to realise that he could not apply these restrictions to the Rajputs or other martial communities whose services the Mughals could not do without. And so the Rajputs and other Hindu clans who were on the payroll of the Mughal army were exempt from these regulations. In Aurangzeb’s eyes, the Shias were as good as infidels but he did not allow his prejudice to interfere with political expediency.\nWhen an amir complained to him about the prominent role played by the Shia Persians in the court, the wily Aurangzeb rebuked him saying that “religion had no place in worldly affairs.” But it was the Jizya that became the most dramatic and blatantly racist expression of Aurangzeb’s anti-Hindu policies. The Jizya was abolished by Akbar in 1564, but on April 12, 1679, Aurangzeb reimposed it. The promulgation of this tax on Hindus was not only opposed by the Hindus but also by important Muslims in the court who argued that the tax was against the tenets of the Mughal empire. But Aurangzeb was stubborn. Even his beloved sister Jahanara pleaded with him, but in vain. She warned him that such a measure could create irreparable fissures in the kingdom.\nAn earthquake struck Delhi after the reimposition of the Jizya, which was a bad omen. Entreaties were made to the emperor again to reconsider his decision but it was not to be. On the contrary, Aurangzeb said that the trembling of the earth was an expression of the joy it felt at the measures he was adopting towards the propagation of Islam. Jahanara’s warning of a rebellion almost became a reality when large numbers of Hindus congregated in Delhi in an attempt to persuade the emperor. One day, when he went to public prayer in the great mosque on the Sabbath, a vast multitude of Hindus thronged the road all the way from the palace to the mosque, hoping against hope that the crowd would weigh on the emperor to reconsider his decision.\nDespite his orders to force a way through, it became impossible for the emperor to reach the mosque. An order was given to bring out the elephants and direct them against the mob. Predictably many were trodden to death.  Yet many Hindus continued to protest. But finally they had no choice but to give in and pay the Jizya. Some Brahmins in Delhi went on a fast against the Jizya but they too had to swallow their pride and give in when they saw that other Hindus had  started paying the Jizya.\nIt was the ordinary Hindus and their local leaders who stood up to protest against the Jizya. There was barely a murmur of protest from the Hindu chiefs serving the emperor who had their careers to think about. Shivaji was the only Hindu king who protested. But he was Aurangzeb’s bitter foe  and had nothing to lose.  He wrote a long letter that dripped with sarcasm to the emperor. In the letter, he taunted Aurangzeb saying that the emperor of Hindustan covets beggar’s bowls, takes Jizya from Brahmins and Jains, yogis, sanyasis, bairagis, paupers and the famine-stricken. By his attacks on the wallets of beggars, he had brought dishonour to his ancestors. He reminded Aurangzeb that the Quran referred to god as ‘rabb-ul-alamin’ or ‘lord of all men’ and not ‘rabb-ul-musalmin’ or ‘lord of the Muhammadans’.  Shivaji argued that the Jizya was not only unjustifiable but also unlawful. Even when Aurangzeb was told that the Jizya was driving Hindu traders away from the Mughal territory in the Deccan, he remained indifferent and rejoiced when he learnt that many Hindus had turned Muhammadean as they were unable to pay the Jizya."}

''preliminary inquiries revealed that the trees were acquired from the forests of karnataka,'' they said. agencies and police were shocked when this lead revealed the links of the industry with the d-company. a senior intelligence agency officer said, ''dawood evinced interest in this business late last year when two leading gutka manufacturers from india took a payment dispute involving rs 15 crore to him for settlement. he settled the dispute in favour of one and asked him to surrender 50 per cent stake.'' chief conservator of forests c krishna said, ''good quality khair is available only in thane (near mumbai) and the forests of karnataka. the kollegal and chamrajnagar forest divisions produce large quantities of khair.'' chief minister krishna said the tree was in demand among gutka manufacturers and there were stray smuggling incidents adding that the department was doing its best to curb mafia activities. aranyabhavan sources revealed that smuggling had taken on a new aspect off late with the timber mafia getting protection from armed gangs. the problem had so far been ignored since khair was not considered important by anti-smuggling units, which tended to concentrate on teak, rose and sal wood. a khair tree can fetch a meagre rs 30 in the market since it does not have any utility value. however, once it is made into pulp and juice is extracted for gutka, the price on the black market multiplies and becomes a sound investment for the underworld. industry sources explained that the pulp was treated in the laboratories in gujarat and then the coagulated juice extracted from pulp was mixed with micals to form synthetic intoxicants. though the quality of these trees in thane was much better, scarcity there had forced manufacturers to sneak into karnataka's forests, they said. intelligence sources revealed that this venture would yield the d-company over rs 25 crore per annum, which dawood was expected to pump into his drug trade in afganisthan."}

{"id":1436979,"url":"http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/magazine\/voices\/2016\/jan\/23\/From-Malda-to-Pathankot-Chinks-in-the-Media-Armour-Lie-Exposed-872614.html","text":"From Malda to Pathankot, Chinks in the Media Armour Lie Exposed\n2016-01-23 22:00:00\nMuch has happened in the past fortnight to leave us deeply disturbed and fuming. It is difficult to overlook the dangerous disregard of national interest that majority of the Indian media is suffering from.\nIt turned a blind eye to the outburst of communal violence in Malda as the instigators and perpetrators didn’t belong to what is referred to as the ‘majority community’. None—who ‘shoot from the lip and the hip’ at the same time and come out both barrels blazing whenever the tattered ‘secular fabric’ appears (to them) endangered—had the courage to even whisper that this time it may have been the work of the ‘lunatic fringe’ of miscreants belonging to some other creed. Anti-social elements, smugglers, flesh traders, drug peddlers and those who deal in illicit arms do not belong to any one religion or country. If they are not identified and exposed whenever they cause bloodshed, leaving behind a trail of innocent dead and vandalised public property, those in power stand without the protection of the proverbial fig leaf.\nMamata Didi lost no time in pronouncing that what happened in Malda had nothing to do with any communal conflict and was just a law and order problem. She obviously doesn’t believe that maintaining law and order is her government’s responsibility. Let us not forget that all riots—communal or secular—mark a failure of the government to avert a breakdown of law and order. If what happened in Malda was a trivial incident, why was so much trouble taken to keep the BJP and CPI(M) fact-finding team out from ‘ground zero’? The task of ‘white-washing’ was taken seriously by the administration—literally. The burnt-down police station was repaired and given a fresh coat of paint overnight. Pictures from the spot, when at long last began to appear on the screen, told a tale very different from what Didi and her minions would have us believe. It is quite possible, as has been alleged by some, that communal tinge was deliberately given to a vandalising mission, systematically executed to destroy evidence of subversive activities of illegal immigrants from across the border and their powerful political patrons. The least that is expected from anyone responsible is restraint in issuing clean chits. But why fault the politicians with an incurable squint—with eyes focused sideways on vote banks? It is the job of the media to put them in the dock and ask inconvenient questions. The double standards in this case were glaring. Partisanship of this kind can only imperil national interest.\nTerrorist attack on the Pathankot airbase exposed another chink in our media armour. ‘Eloquence’ out of place can be as perilous as silence when speaking out was required. The temptation to break news before a rival channel does, can and, in the past, has had fatal consequences. Not for the celebrity reporter-anchors but for poor men in uniform combating the enemy. There can be no place for unfettered and exclusive right to freedom of media in any democracy however vibrant. Minute-to-minute eye-witness accounts and excerpts of knee-jerk comments from blatantly partisan analysts not only jeopardise a counter-terrorist operation underway, but can also seriously demoralise the men in uniform. The Pathankot incident too exposed how far the malignant cancer of corruption has spread. It is not just that a senior officer of the Punjab Police is under suspicion, some men in the Army and Air Force too have fallen in the honey or money trap. Once again, eager beavers of the media on the perpetual lookout to perform a hatchet job on their respective ‘hit lists’ rushed to write between lines lest we fail to ‘read’ the blank space. They shouted themselves hoarse drawing the battle of turf between the Army, Air Force and Punjab Police. Without a pause to catch their breath, they insinuated that what we were watching was the tip of an iceberg—a massive smuggling operation gone wrong and to fill the background, dramatic re-enactments of the modus operandi with complicity of rotten eggs in the BSF were screened. The home minister was not spared either. Speculative reports based on unnamed sources launched rumour-mongering kites to inform us how unhappy he was at being ‘left out of the loop’.\nThe Opposition seemed to be working overtime to register one more failure of the NDA government just because elections are near in these two states.

According to his friends and family, Kiran and his friend Sridhar, who is from Rajahmundry, returned home from shopping on that fateful evening. When they were about to enter their apartment, unidentified men, believed to be blacks, demanded money from them. But they confronted the thugs who pumped two bullets into Kiran’s stomach and also wounded Sridhar before fleeing with the laptops of both. The two wounded men were admitted to a hospital in Johannesburg where doctors could remove one bullet from Kiran’s body.

Despite being riddled with graft allegations, he believes that UDF will be back on the throne. As unique as his name, the 72-year-old is juggling and jockeying issues in a unique style. The way he defused the dissent and inducted his Cabinet colleagues into the candidates list has made him a numero uno for the warring groups. In his 11th battle at Puthuppally in his elaborate 46-year career, he hope to win the battle on his home turf and the war in state.\nTo those outside Pala, the borough belongs to K M Mani. The electoral battles were akin the floods in the river Meenachil that retreated without wreaking havoc after licking the shores.  Hence, ‘Mani Saar’ reigned supreme since 1965. The cloud of graft allegations is threatening to eclipse his onrush, incidentally, the 13th from Pala. Triskaidekaphobia, or the fear of 13, does not feature in the lexicon of the 83-year-old stalwart, though he had to step down after presenting his thirteenth budget on March 13, 2015, a Friday. His rival from the last two battles, another Mani, could eat into his margin. Can he continue his feted winning streak?\nA teacher by profession, C F Thomas learned the art of survival from his chieftain K M Mani. But unlike many of his contemporaries in the party, he did not ditch his master in dire times. The true Mani loyalist that he is, he even took his demotion to deputy chairman in the stride. Hence he made the cut in Changanassery, a ‘sure seat’ for Mani group in  Pala, from where CF won the eight elections on the trot in the last 36 years. Though some of his juniors had demanded a change in guard, CF said he would take the door after this election, where he faces another veteran who was in his state committee 50 days ago. Taking it a step further, the 76-year-old even appealed to the electorate  to elect his successor in the next election.\nThe free run of P J Joseph to the state Assembly in the last 46 years was interrupted only twice, in 1991 and 2001. For the rest of the 36 years he represented Thodupuzha. A pioneer in organic farming in the state, the 73- year-old knows well that politics also should be of that nature. Hence he merged his party with that of K M Mani and did not revive the ‘Joseph’ faction despite the big cries of his loyalists. Though much of his confidants have deserted him, he is confident that the lost sheep would return soon after the Assembly polls.\nUnlike a majority of those who migrated to Malabar from Kottayam, K C Joseph still travels to Kannur more than once a week. His detractors ask why he has no house, not even a rented one, in a place that sent him to the Assembly seven times. A firm believer, Joseph was saved by his lord who stood by him citing that he has only 34 years as a member from Irikkoor. But his rivals are in no mood to relent and has opened an FB page to wage a strident war against him. For someone who had apologised unconditionally via FB for making adverse remarks about an HC judge, FB blues give still give him the shivers.\nAn electoral battle at 92 is no duck soup for any politician. But V S Achuthanandan is not just any politician. For him, it is just another day in his exuberant political career spanning more than seven decades. Moving with times is his forte. He recently forayed into social media with the poise of a pro,  leaving the cloud dwellers agog every day with his prompt posts and untamed tweets. The former Chief Minister was elected to the state Assembly six times and was the Leader of Opposition on three ocassions. Unlike two previous terms, the party went soft on the veteran and allotted him his sitting seat, Malampuzha, where one of his main rival is 60 years younger to him. However, the battle being fought at one of the hottest locales in the state will also see a nonagenarian fighting the war of ages."}

So ditch your cotton trousers for what’s in this fashion season – highwaist shorts.\nNot just giving you the casual look, they very much say you are “in charge.”\nl So proportion is key. The waistband should always be visible, or what is the point? Shirts should be tucked in or cropped high. Wide pants work best with a lean jacket; a long pencil skirt takes a loose blouse. Reach for shoes with platforms or stacked heels that let people know you mean business.\nl To own the look, you don’t need to go out and find a pair of shorts that reaches above your belly button. If you have a shorter torso (or a larger bust), go for styles that are cut comfortably over your hip bones, but not all the way up to the smallest part of your waist. Because low-cut styles have been popular for so long, even a mid-rise cut will give you the look of the trend.\nl Tuck in your shirt. This is a no-brainer, but show off your trendsetting ways by tucking in your top and emphasizing your new shorts.\nl DIY a pair! A good way to test the waters on this trend is to pick up a pair of jeans from a thrift shop and cut them into shorts yourself. Cuff the hems for an extra cute look. Don’t worry if you grab a pair that’s a little big on you - the style will look great with a belt, and the loose garment throughout the butt and thighs will look more “street chic” than “Mom Jean!”\nl Show some leg.

They may be a distortion of reality, but let us be charitable. By attributing these qualities to these insentient elements, these Nature lovers are only trying to integrate them into their world. I have often caught myself engaging in this exercise. I once found myself comparing a patch of forest land overrun with thorny shrubs, thistles and nettles that left their marks on me, to an angry porcupine flaring its painful bristles. So, I am not surprised when the word 'majestic' rolls off my tongue involuntarily as I come upon the Keerapakkam hills. They bring to mind the image of a pride of lions resting after a filling meal, with an air of majestic nonchalance towards their surroundings.\nKeerapakkam derives its charm almost entirely from these hills. This village panchayat, located off the Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road and accessed via a road branching off this state highway at Mellakotaiyur, is sufficiently inhabited for the Metropolitan Transport Corporation to operate bus services to it with reasonable frequency.\nWhile heading towards these hills, I notice two buses swish past me, in the opposite direction. One is them is from Tambaram to Keerapakkam. And the other, if my eyesight has not failed me, is from Guduvanchery to Keerapakkam Koot Road. Later, with some research, I discover that the service from Tambaram is operated with a 50-minute frequency. Though Keerapakkam is well-populated, the human element is put in the shade by those 'majestic' hills.\nOne of these hills is accustomed to the tread of tyres and feet from other parts of the city. It has a Baba temple. A concrete road takes visitors up to a point. From there, they have to climb to the summit. From the other side of the hill, there is a route for people to reach this same point, either walking or riding a motorcycle. This stretch makes for an energising walk. A view of this hill with the Keerapakkam lake in the foreground is arresting.\nHeading out from this hill, one can reach a few other hills, taking a matrix of roads, most of them well-laid. The other hills in and around Keerapakkam don't betray much of human movement and climbing them early in the morning can be an enchanting experience.\nBesides climbing these hills, just treading down these quiet roads in this sound-proofed region gives you a sense of disdainfully throwing the problems of existence over your shoulder and walking away from them.\n( Hidden Trails is column that shows you how to be a tourist in your own city. )\nRelated Topics"}

This can be done either by allowing apartments or by giving a nod to the division of large plots into smaller ones. Once finalised, the proposal would be part of the Master Plan that is being prepared for the city. The plan for redensification would include the first phase sectors from Sectors 1 to 30.\nOf these Sectors 1 to 9 are especially sparsely populated while the central and southern sectors have a substantial part of the population residing there. The shrinking land in the city is a major concern in preparation of the Master Plan.\nThe city ranks second in population density in the country, just behind Delhi-NCR. The population density is 9,252 per sq kilometre against 7,900 per sq kilometre in 2001. With space being limited, there is a problem of housing for the growing population. There are a large number of migrants in the city who are settled in the colonies and slums.\nWhile houses are being built under the Rehabilitation Scheme, it is likely that there would be a need for more houses. It has also been proposed that in the northern sectors, it would be made mandatory to provide a room for domestic helps to live in.\nSome of these sectors have houses built on areas of six canals and above where the number of people residing is low.

Gupta\nIn 2012, when he decided to become a filmmaker after spending over a decade as a film critic, Pratim D. Gupta noticed that the Bengali film industry was clearly divided into two extremes: art house and mainstream cinema. It’s a split that continues to exist.\nThe 34-year-old Gupta says, “There are art house films which are struggling with box-office pressure, and then there are the loud mainstream movies, which are often remakes of Tamil and Telugu films.” He believes that the Bengali film industry, which has had a chequered past, boasting of legendary directors like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen and Rituparno Ghosh, is currently in a very confused state.\n“The only way Bengali films can bounce back is by bringing in the young audiences, that is people from 18 to 30 years.” How? He thinks “superior production values and sleek treatment” could do the trick. “The youth of Kolkata is into watching TV series and their eyes are attuned to watching [good production and] sleek stuff,” he says. “You can’t fool them by saying we didn’t have the budget so we made something artsy and not visually appealing, with low production value.”\nHis latest film, Shaheb Bibi Golaam — which released in West Bengal last Friday, and will release in other cities across India on September 2 — was made keeping the young audience in mind.\nThe thriller tells the story of three people, living starkly different lives, whose destinies intertwine because of one mistake.\nGupta says the pressure to do well is being felt by Bengali filmmakers across the board. “The attempt to win [at] the box office has also affected veteran filmmakers like Aparna Sen, which is very disheartening,” he says.\n“She can’t make what she wants to make. Of the new-age filmmakers, some are trying hard. Filmmakers like Shiboprosad Mukherjee made Bela Seshe last year and Praktan this year, which have both been huge successes. At least he is getting the people in; which is very good.”\nAll this comes at a time when the Indian audience is slowly getting more cine literate and receptive to films in all languages and from all nationalities. Gupta says regional movies with subtitles are gaining popularity as long they are made well. “We obviously can’t match the production values of a Hindi film, but if there is a good word of mouth from the Kolkata release, I’m sure a week later a lot of friends in other cities will watch it,” he says.\nThere has been this confusion that a film titled Shaheb Bibi Golaam would be a Bengali remake of the 1962 Guru Dutt and Meena Kumari one. “Anybody who wants to see the movie must have definitely seen the trailer or the poster at least,” says Gupta. “That makes it very clear that is has nothing to do with the Hindi classic.”\nGupta considered naming the film, Jimmy Jaya Javed and Trikaal before zeroing in on Shaheb Bibi Golaam .\nThe film — starring Anjan Dutt, Swastika Mukherjee and Ritwick Chakraborty in the lead roles — is Gupta’s second feature film. He made X: Past Is Present in 2015, which was a collaborative feature film directed by a team of 10 other filmmakers.\nHowever, Gupta says it is completely different from his directorial debut, Paanch Adhyay , which also saw actress Dia Mirza make her first foray into Bengali cinema. “My first film was more like learning on the job. When you shoot you realise that you can’t do a lot that’s possible on paper,” says Gupta.\nFor him, one of the biggest takeaways from his first film was getting the casting right. “ Paanch Adhyay was about good-looking actors. But this one is about good actors. Even if some of them are unknown names, they are great performers,” says Gupta.\nAs for finding himself back at the helm of a feature film after four years, he says, “This one is a reboot for me as a filmmaker.”\nThis one [Shaheb\nBibi Golaam] is a reboot for me as\na filmmaker"}

Tata was clearly alluding to the BJP.\nFor, although the BJP has refrained from joining issue  pointing out that it prefers to stay away from corporate rivalries  Chandrasekhar's record shows a strong association with the BJP.\nChandrasekhar, however, told The Indian Express: \"I am an Independent MP. I have no affiliation with any party. I have worked with the BJP wherever there was an alignment of my interests and the interests of the BJP. But that doesn't make me a BJP person.\" Consider his record of \"alignment of interests.\"\nChandrasekhar was elected to the Rajya Sabha with the support of parties including the BJP.

Six official amendments, including scrapping of one per cent additional tax, moved by the government were approved with cent per cent votes.\nThe bill was passed by the Lok Sabha earlier. It will now go back to the Lower House to incorporate the amendments approved by the Rajya Sabha. The bill will also have to be approved by 50 per cent of all the state assemblies.\nAIADMK was the only party to oppose the measure and its members staged a walkout from the House to register their unhappiness over the bill which lays the ground for rollout of uniform Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime that will subsume all indirect taxes including central excise duty and state VAT\/sales tax.\nThe easy passage was facilitated after the main opposition party Congress, which had been stalling the measure for over two years, came on board after the government made about six changes in the bill, including scrapping of 1 per cent manufacturing tax and incorporate clearer provisions for compensating states for revenue loss for five years.\nReplying to the debate during which most parties pressed for a Constitutional cap on GST tax rate at 18 per cent, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the guiding principle would be to keep the \"rates as low as possible, certainly lower than what it is today.\"\nUnder the modified provisions, GST Council will be required to establish a mechanism for adjudication of disputes, which could arise between the Centre and states or among states themselves.\nThe 2014 bill authorised GST Council to decide upon the modalities for resolution of disputes.\nWith these official amendments, the government has partially met the demands of the Congress party which has been blocking the bill in the Rajya Sabha. One of the three demands of the Congress was to do away with the 1 per cent additional manufacturing tax.\nOn the demand for a Supreme Court judge-headed panel for resolving GST disputes, the official amendments say that the GST Council will establish a mechanism for solving disputes.\nWith regard to the demand for putting a GST rate cap in the Constitution, Jaitley said that the decision would be taken by the GST Council which will have representation from the centre as well as states."}

Karan  admitted that the manner in which the family planning programme was brought into disrepute by callous, overzealous and unimaginative implementation in some states had serious consequences for the future welfare of the nation.\n“We particularly had heard of a very bad incident. One of my officers was on a tour. He came back and told us of an incident in which people travelling in a bus -- I’m not sure whether it was in Rajasthan or Haryana -- were taken off and herded into sterilisation camps. So, in fact, we specifically mentioned this to a Haryana minister and of course at that time they simply denied that it was happening,” Karan had told the inquiry commission.\nWithholding the salary of a person unless he submitted himself to sterilisation was “very draconian”, he had said.\nSince states were the implementing agencies under the sterilisation programme, which was 100 per cent financed by the Centre, Karan said he could only request the Chief Ministers to prevent its abuse. “This is one of those strange occasions during which a good federal principle, in fact, worked in the opposite direction to what might be expected,” Karan told the Panel in his statement on July 7, 1978.\nAlthough the Shah Commission had received reports about 1,642 deaths due to forced sterilisation and subsequent infection during the Emergency, it indicated that the figure could be much higher. “We (Health Ministry) did get complaints, reports from time to time that those certain mortalities had taken place,” he admitted.\nSome states had raised their sterilisation targets to 400 per cent.\nKaran also said the sterilisation programme was abandoned under political compulsion sometime late in 1976.\n“Once the elections had been decided upon and announced, I think it was realised that this was causing a great deal of political fallout, and therefore the whole matter should be kept in abeyance until the outcome of the election,” he said."}

In the weeks and months that followed, they talked about his recommendation  without many following it. The scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family, however, does seem to have audacious hopes: to reclaim the party's traditional support among the Dalit votebank.\nOn Thursday, in Congress-ruled Haryana he paid an unscheduled visit to the Dalit victims of caste violence in a village in Hisar district. It did not matter, clearly, how his visit would reflect on Bhupinder Singh Hooda's government as long as the message reached Lucknow. Barely 48 hours earlier, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had voted for the UPA government in the Lok Sabha, sparking off speculation about new possibilities in Uttar Pradesh's political theatre. Rahul's visit to Mirchpur village in Haryana set the record straight: he will continue to challenge Mayawati in his endeavour to win over Dalits.\nRahul was audacious too at Ambedkarnagar in UP on April 14, when he used a single garland to cover the portraits of both Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar on the latter's birth anniversary. Rahul was not just laying out the Congress's claims on Ambedkar  he said it was the Congress that made him chairman of the Constituent Assembly and the country's law minister  and challenging Mayawati's politics of identity and symbolism, he was also rejecting the BSP's re-casting of the father of the nation.\nRight from his DS-4 days in the early '80s, Kanshi Ram had sought to undermine Gandhi, criticising his use of the word \"Harijan\" as condescending and replacing it with \"Dalit\". \"If Dalits are 'children of god' then was he (Gandhi) son of shaitan?\" Mayawati was to ask later in 1997."}

The Master Plan of Delhi-2021 (MPD-2021) has proposed the redevelopment of built areas through the process of reorganisation and utilisation of the existing land to accommodate more population in a planned manner. As part of this process, the \"Special Area\", which encircles three prominent old areas namely, Walled City, Walled City and Extension, and Karol Bagh, is identified as one of the areas for redevelopment.\nThe strategy is to provide suitable framework for allowing mixed-use activities appropriate to the character of the areas as per the individual schemes having greater flexibility in terms of permitting variety of uses besides accommodating more population.\nTo analyse the trends in commercialisation in the area, a socio-economic survey of households and commercial establishments was conducted in various parts of the Special Area. The employment pattern within the area is unique in all parts. Part-wise analysis of activities indicates an association of specific type of establishments with each part.\nThe employment in Part-1 (Walled City) is mainly in garment-related trade, in Part-2 (Walled City extension, Sadar Bazar and Paharganj) a variety of employment avenues exist in trade related to garments, electronic goods and auto parts. Establishments dealing in garments and jewellery predominate Part-3 (Karol Bagh-Commercial). Part-4 (Karol Bagh) is marked by furniture and auto parts businesses and Part-5 (Old Sabzi Mandi\/Roshanara Road) is known mainly for industrial activities and trade in fruits and vegetables.\nThe survey covered aspects such as demography, employment, type and size of establishments, mode of transportation of produced goods and other economic characteristics. They were analysed comparatively for the different parts of the Special Area. The analyses led to the finding that various parts have varying economic vibrancy, which is related to future commercialisation. It was found that Part-3 that includes the Karol Bagh area has the maximum economic vibrancy. Surprisingly Part-1, which from the outside appears to be most highly commercialised is ranked lowest in terms of economic vibrancy. This may be due to the fact that in Karol Bagh, where the layout is based on a grid-iron pattern, the commercial use has penetrated deeply. In Part-1, the old city of Shahjahanabad, the dead end pattern of streets with narrow widths does not allow such commercial penetration. It is by and large confined to the peripheral roads and has less scope for further increase unless redeveloped. Part-2 stands third in the ranking and shows moderate potential for economic upscaling."}

This amounts to a significant, about $15 billion. In that context these initiatives by the Ministry of Commerce is really a welcome step.”\nJyotiraditya Scindia, who chaired the task force, is of the view that permanent reduction of transaction cost will have a long term positive impact on the competitiveness of India’s exports.\nUnion Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said that the average cost to move a container within India is $945, more than double the cost of the export giant China’s $460, Malaysia’s $450 and Vietnam $625.\nAfter a decline in 2009-10, India’s exports, which contributes about 20 per cent to GDP, have grown by an impressive 29.5 per cent during April-December 2010-11.\nWelcoming the report, industry chamber FICCI said,  “Permanent reduction of transaction cost through these initiatives will have a long term positive impact on the competitiveness of India’s exports.”\n“Reducing transaction cost is the key to export development as global competitiveness today depends on being able to be a low-cost producer and at the same time a reliable supplier,” CII said."}

{"id":1369554,"url":"http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/cities\/bengaluru\/2013\/aug\/19\/The-grand-scale-view-of-dance-508107.html","text":"The grand-scale view of dance\n2013-08-19 08:39:00\nChoreographing classical dance is nothing but creating dance. It is a great and separate skill indeed.  It is more than composing a dance. In the olden days, nattuvanars perhaps never thought of it that way. They seemed to be content with composing dance, inserting and interpreting hasta and pada abhinaya. A wider concept of dance presentation with proper management of space, auditorium, ambience, props, backdrop, artistic direction of music, sets, lights, colour and so many other things make dance choreography a wholesome skill. Thus, it is not just depiction of a pada word-to-word but about comprehensive treatment.\nThe complete colourful imagery that a successful dance choreographer tries to create materialises in a very subjective and personal interpretation of ideas. The legendary Uday Shankar and, later on, Rukmini Devi are pioneers of classical dance choreography, in its wider sense.\nIn Bharatanatyam, all varieties of emotions are expressed through eyes, face, limbs and through every part of the body.  According to the demands of varied emotions, these are used and the level of their usage is determined by the choreography. A few emotions are expressed wonderfully by using angikas only. Nritta (pure technique) and abhinaya (mime or expression) are the most important elements of Bharatanatya. Its nritta comprises intricate rhythmic footwork that includes strikes, extensions, jumps and leaps, plus the complicated patterns made by the hands and arms, all stemming from an extended, dynamic torso.  In this way, it is noteworthy that the dancer’s whole body becomes geometry in motion.\nBharatanatyam is bhakti and shringara oriented and has intimate connections with Indian mythology and culture. Carnatic music has been its live wire. The combinations and subtleties of the movements and themes, their close connections with Carnatic music generate a rare union of complexity and accessibility, in Bharatanatya sensibilities, leading to the creation of dance of great beauty.\nA senior-most disciple of guru Lalitha Srinivasan and a seasoned dancer, musician, choreographer Suma Krishnamurthy reveled in her dance choreography which encompassed all the above aspects and did her guru proud. She did a good job of choreographing marga items which have been recorded on her recently released CD called Natya Sakhi. The senior disciples of guru Lalitha Srinivasan presented them at Khimcha auditorium, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, on last Saturday. The music direction by Suma’s violinist-husband T S Krishnamurthy was apt. The dance segments were enjoyable and were handled skillfully by Lathitha’s students. The evening’s programme opened with a rendition of Angikam bhuvanam. Young Nikhita, who did her rangapravesha recently, gave an excellent account of her talent and artistry by presenting Pushpanjali followed by Ashta Dikpaalaka dhyana shloka, Shiva stuti et al. Seasoned dancers Prashanth Sastry and his wife Sunitha Sastry rendered Hamsadhwani jathiswara, demonstrating a praiseworthy understanding, synchronisation and rhythmic hold. The melkaala jathis were done with ease by the couple. Thanks to Suma’s choreography, the talent, technique and artistry of Bharatanatyam had a delightful confluence.\nSahana Dasharathi and Srividya teamed up well to elaborate a Kannada varna (Neela megha Shyama Sundarana kare taare in Ragamalika and adi tala). It was about a virahothkhantitha nayaki who pleads with her sakhi to fetch her Lord Krishna. The high-strung choreography bound them together. Usage of ragas like Shuddha Saveri, Kaanada, Mohana, Kapi, Saveri and others were appropriate to the moods of the song. The nritta, nrithya and abhinaya had a balanced representation and Sahana, in particular, drew special attention of the rasikas. Sunitha Sastry’s enactment of a vasika sajjika nayaki on the basis of Kalyani javali was profound.  Sahana, Srividya, Nikhila, Sindhoora and Maanasi brought the curtains down with their crisp delineation of a tillana in Revathi raga.\nA prolific guru, Nagabhushan deserves to be commended for his artistic direction which made his student Praanjala’s Bharatanatya held at Ravindra Kalakshetra on Thursday, a taut performance, energetic movements and grounded in its classical grammar and vocabulary. Her neatly etched movement lines with a well-balanced body easily translated Guru Nagabhushan’s choreographic ideas.\nAccompanied ably by the Guru himself on nattuvanga, the musical ensemble had Tandavamurthy, Nagaraj, Shankararaman, Purushottam and Vivek Krishna on violin, mridanga, veena, morsing and flute, respectively.\nThe traditional Pushpanjali was followed by a salutation to Gajavadana (Hamsadhwani), the elephant-headed God. Praanjala etched varied forms of the Goddess on the basis of popular Mohanakalyani krithi Bhuvaneshwariya. Technical precision and geometric skill abounded, as the Bhairavi varna unfolded, addressing Lord Krishna. The three divisions of the varna -- nritta, nrithya and abhinaya -- were done with joy and abandon. Her abhinaya skills were fully on view in the rendition of a Purandaradasa pada (ragamalika) and a gem of a krithi by Muthuswamy Dikshitar in Madhyamavathi raga (Pannagashayana) extolling Lord Vishnu. The dance came to a close with a Dhanasri tillana which was marked by varied adavus, rechikas and teermanas.\nThe concluding session of Haridasa Sambhrama-2013, held on Sunday at Sri Kannika Parameshwari Temple, under the aegis of Nadajyothi Sri Thyagara-jaswamy Bhajana Sabha, began with a scholarly vocal recital by Tirumale Srinivas supported by C Ramesh (vocal) and party. He beautified the Abhogi composition (Anubhavisi) with swaras. Kaanadihudake kannadi eke (Kaanada) and Dehadolagina devaru (Anandabhairavi) were full of emotions. The Charukeshi alapana was short and sweet. He concluded with Innenu innenu (Nadanamakriya).\nSeasoned singer Vani Satish sang padas by different Haridasas in a lovely manner. Mareyadiru (Kanakadasa, Behag), Antarangadali (Mohana), Kelanohari (Poorvikalyani), Ele mana (Salagabhairavi) and Manava-shodhisabeku (Shubhap-antuvarali) had a fine diction and left sweet memories behind. Mysore Satish(violin) and Renukaprasad (mridanga) were the accompanists.\nVeteran singer M S Sheela led her group of students in the Goshti gayana of Purandaradasa’s Navarathnamalika krithis."}

Two federal agents, roped in to track down supernatural objects and store them in a mysterious place, which only very few people have heard of. Their boss is a shadowy figure and government intrigue spices up matters. Sounds familiar? It should  Warehouse 13 has been called, at various times and in altering permutations and combinations, a mix of The X-Files, Moonlighting, Raiders of the Lost Ark and even Bones. It certainly borrows government intrigue from The X-Files, undeniable chemistry in professional partnerships from Moonlighting, treasure-hunting from Raiders and light bantering humour from Bones. But the final result is uniquely Warehouse 13's  a fun ride through weird happenings along with agents Peter Lattimer and Myka Bering, while they run around trying to find what's going to ruin the world's day.\nWho's in it? Eddie McClintock stars as Agent Lattimer  a slightly goofy, but eminently loveable agent, whose sense of humour hides a sharp mind and sixth sense with regard to immediate dangers. Joanne Kelly is Agent Beringthe class swot to Lattimer's class clown. The two have a very Mulder-Scully relationship; he likes to bend the rules, she likes to follow them to the letter, but luckily they're not in-your-face aggressive and seem to enjoy each other's company than otherwise. Their immediate superior is Dr Artie Nielsen, a rather serious agent, who looks on Warehouse 13 as his life's work. Other characters are the eerie, and apparently ageless, boss Mrs Irene Frederic and Claudia Donovan, the brilliant technowiz.\nWhat's hot? Unlike most other shows of a similar nature, Warehouse 13 does not take itself too seriously. Even the premise of the show  the snagging, bagging and tagging of supernatural artefacts  is dealt with light-heartedly (there's a memorable scene where Lattimer has a ping-pong match with his reflection in Lewis Carroll's Looking Glass). A lot of the humour comes from Artie taking his work too seriously and in the process getting annoyed with his subordinates, who can't seem to get used to the peculiarities of the warehouse."}

A nominal fare will be charged for the food. To begin with, the menu includes three to four different varieties of snacks. Besides mineral water, tender coconut water too will quench the commuters’ thirst.\nOfficials said that there were good catering services on trains and flights which were on par with international standards.

But the facts of the event belied all wrong notions and negative vibes passed into the oblivion as the sammelan became a success, though adversaries kept on threatening to spoil the show over one or the other pretext.\nThere were many minor lacunae, of course. They pertained to food and its quality, accommodation, difficulty in reaching the venue, the Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa College grounds, choked toilets, and the biting cold in evenings. However, many were of the opinion that ‘everything was good’ since a tiny place such as Madikeri was hosting the show. Lots of dust flying in the air at the venue made many sick.\nThe threat by a committee formed by citizens to oppose the K. Kasturirangan Committee report on western ghats in Kodagu to observe a bandh on January 7 dissipated after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah assured a delegation of the committee to look into the issue. A group of people who wanted the president of the sammelan Na. D’Souza to tender apologies for his remarks on the Kasturirangan committee report had even succeeded in reaching the dais. But, Mr. D’Souza stated he did not issue any statement supporting the implementation of the report in Kodagu. The group opposing previous sammelan president Ko. Chennabasappa’s book glorifying Tipu and the other supporting the book too had threatened to spoil the show.\nStatements of the Central Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Bangalore, Pundalika Halambi, created a sensation when he accounted for the curtailment of the speech of Mr. D’Souza, but he later apologised. Short-circuit causing fire when a particular session was on created a minor scare after which the fire was doused in time.\nThe small or narrow roads of Madikeri looked as if they were unable to ‘bear the load’ of people who walked from the Maitree Police Hall junction to the venue, while vehicles with official passes scrambled along precariously avoiding the surging crowd. Locals were seen thronging book stalls and participating in the evening cultural programmes. They reaffirmed their faith in dance and music as they would do during the famous Madikeri Dasara festivities.\nPolicemen had a tough job in controlling the crowd, indulging in verbal duels with people. However, not much was done by them when hundreds of government employees, including teachers, played spoilsport close to the dais on all three days of the sammelan, shouting slogans demanding OOD coupons to claim the benefits while they went back to their respective workplaces.\nA large number of visitors empathised with the organisers.\nRelated Topics"}

The spring migration season draws lower numbers because the birds are less plump.\n\"The situation is very worrying -- it's actually getting worse,\" said Martin Hellicar of the association BirdLife Cyprus.\nBut Hellicar said the activity has made a strong comeback over the past seven years, with some 150 species affected indiscriminately, including a number already threatened with extinction.\nOn paper\nEcologists say the situation is worst on the British sovereign bases, a hangover from the colonial era that ended with Cyprus's independence in 1960.\nPrince Charles, himself a keen conservationist, wrote to President Nicos Anastasiades and the commander of the British military on the island to condemn the \"industrial-scale killing\" of birds.\n\"We prosecute about 200 cases a year, more than that, and each case can be more than one person. We have vigorous campaigns,\" said Game and Fauna Service head Pantelis Hajiyerou.\n\"There is a major decrease\" in trapping in government-controlled Cyprus \"but an increase in the (British) bases,\" he said.\nHajiyerou said plans are being drawn up for a \"holistic approach on the poaching problem\", including education on the island where tradition is all-important and 90 percent of people \"don't think it's wrong to eat ambelopoulia\".\nBirdLife Cyprus said that the law -- \"on paper\" -- provides for hefty penalties of up to three years behind bars and fines as high as 17,000 euros.\nBut the sentences passed so far have been a few hundred euros in fines, serving as \"no deterrent at all\", Hellicar said.AFP\nAmbelopoulia is a controversial dish of grilled, pickled or boiled songbirds. It is illegal in Cyprus as it involves trapping wild birds such as Blackcaps and European Robins.\nThe trappers defend their activity by citing the practice as traditional Cypriot food gathering and historically this has been an important source of protein for the natives\nBirdlife Cyprus has identified restaurants as the main culprits as they provide the financial incentives\nRelated Topics"}

But the lower surface area of the fibre limits the absorption capacity. In order to enhance the absorption capacity, some brands use superabsorbent polymers (cross-linked sodium polyacrylate gels). When polymerised acrylate is added to cellulose, the resulting product has enormous ability to absorb water, which has caused an increased use of this substance in the production of hygiene products such as sanitary napkins.\nChandra Shekhar Sharma from the Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad and his team turned to nanotechnology to produce cellulose-based nanofibre for use as an absorbent core in sanitary napkins. They chose cellulose acetate biopolymer and subjected it to electrospinning to synthesise fibre of nanoscale size.\nCompared with micron-sized fibre used in commercially available products, the absorption capacity of napkins with nanofibre was higher due to greater surface area and higher porosity. “The more the surface area of the fibres the more will be the absorption capacity,” Prof. Sharma says. “The nanofibre has 4-8 times the surface area of microfibre.” The results were published in the journal Applied Materials Today.\nThey tested commercially available napkins and the nanofibre samples in the lab using distilled water, saline solution and synthetic urine. In the case of distilled water, at the end of 180 seconds, napkins with a superabsorbent layer had a higher absorption capacity compared with nanofibre samples. However, nanofibre samples had 50 per cent more absorbance than those that either had little or very less superabsorbent polymers.\nIn the case of saline solution, the nanofibre samples had 53-63 per cent greater absorption capacity compared with the rest of the commercially available samples, including those which had superabsorbent polymers. “The basic driving force for absorbency is the difference in osmotic pressure inside and outside the fabric,” Prof. Sharma says. “The superabsorbent polymers have sodium ions. So the osmotic pressure is less as there is sodium inside and outside the polymers. The more the osmotic pressure the more the absorption.”\nSimilar results were seen when synthetic urine was tested. The nanofibre samples had 28-66 per cent better performance than all the commercially available samples. “Like the sodium solution, synthetic urine, too, contains sodium. So the osmotic pressure is less, and there is less absorption of water,” says Shital Yadav from IIT Hyderabad, the first author of the paper.\nThe electrospun nanofibre samples performed better even when they were subjected to mechanical compression. In the case of commercially available napkins, compression decreased the surface area and porosity and restricted the absorption capacity of even the samples with superabsorbent polymers.\nAlso, compared with commercially available napkins, the mechanical strength and comfort were better in the case of electrospun nanofibre samples. “Unlike commercially available napkins that use microfibre, nanofibre is smooth and has uniform roughness. These make the nanofibre samples more comfortable,” says Mani Pujitha Illa, one of the authors of the paper, from IIT Hyderabad.\nThe team is carrying out studies to test the performance of electrospun nanofibre to absorb body discharge fluids. “The pH and ionic concentration determine the absorption capacity of superabsorbent polymers.

While getting a pet is a random act for many, very few realise the responsibility that comes with it. Sadly, reports of abuse and abandonment of pets either due to old age or illness are on the rise. One must first realise the importance of responsible ownership before making the decision of bringing a pet home.\nFirst and foremost, one must understand that companion animals are social beings: they need attention, interaction and love. Anything that compromises these aspects in their lives would result in serious behavioural issues. Pets are very much like children and need to be treated in the same manner – physical punishment and cruel training methods (that cause fear or pain) must not be used against them. Solitary confinement in kennels and tying them up for long periods of time are to be avoided. The health and safety of pets need to be ensured through periodic visits to the veterinarian and keeping vaccinations current. They have to be kept well nourished, groomed, properly exercised and socialised. It is also important to remember that as an animal owner, one has responsibility towards society as well. Simple acts such as using a leash while taking your pet for walks must be followed without fail. One should realise that companion animals have short life spans and it is important to be there for them during the difficult journeys of their lives such as illness and old age. Senior pets need all the reassurance you can give them. Abandoning them during that time is total lack of compassion. A well cared-for pet can provide great enjoyment, companionship and pleasure. Owning a companion animal is therefore a rewarding experience but not without the responsibilities and commitment.\nMINI VASUDEVAN\n(The author is a telecommunications engineer and co-founder of HumaneAnimal Society Coimbatore – www.hasindia.org)\nRelated Topics"}

Therefore, he must give a statement in Parliament on the issue of religious conversions to clarify his government's stand on such a sensitive matter,\" Scindia told PTI.\nThe Congress leader was here to dedicate a road near Bhopal Airport named after his father and former Union minister, the late Madhavrao Scindia.\nAnswering a question, he said that an attempt is being made in this country to polarise society and the same is reflected in statements by BJP ministers, MPs and MLAs on sensitive issues.\n\"It is reflected in the way ministers, MPs and MLAs give statements to damage the country's secular credentials with an aim to polarise the country,\" he said.\n\"I can't even think of using such a language that these leaders openly do,\" Scindia remarked.   The Opposition has stalled the Rajya Sabha on the issue of religious conversions demanding a statement from the Prime Minister, after reports of alleged attempts to convert people surfaced from Agra.\nReferring to lowering of petrol and diesel prices in the country, he said that there is a decline of nearly 45 per cent in global crude oil prices, but the same has not been passed on to consumers.\nHe said that Congress workers in Madhya Pradesh have to work hard from \"top to bottom and from bottom to top\" at all levels, to fight the BJP. When asked about the issue of lack of unity among top Congress leaders in the state, Scindia said that it is not an issue, since all of them including himself and Madhya Pradesh Congress president Arun Yadav have been toiling for the party in the state.\nCommenting on reports about a medical college being shifted from Shivpuri, which is part of his constituency Guna, and the Madhya Pradesh Health Minister's stand that Shivpuri's name was not mentioned when the Centre sanctioned medical colleges in different cities of the state, Scindia strongly criticised the BJP-led state government on the issue.\nHe said that he had already met Union Health Minister J P Nadda and would also raise the issue with the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.\nScindia said that records clearly stated that Shivpuri's name was mentioned in the list of medical colleges allocated to Madhya Pradesh.\nEarlier, addressing a function after dedicating the road named after his father, Scindia called him as a \"visionary,\" and said that people talk about bullet trains, but his father dreamt of it as early as 1984-85 when he was made Railway Minister by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.\n\"The first high-speed Shatabdi train was introduced between New Delhi and Bhopal at that time, purely because of his (Madhavrao Scindia's) vision,\" he said.\nLater, Scindia, along with former Union Minister Suresh Pachouri and Arun Yadav, dedicated another road named after former deputy chief minister, late Subhash Yadav in the New Market area.\nArun Yadav is the son of Subhash Yadav.\nJust ahead of the local body elections in Bhopal, two roads were named in the city after two senior Congress leaders."}

The model-turned-actor, who made his silver screen debut with Radha Mohan’s Abhiyum Naanum (2008), is a busy man these days with projects like Nayaki, Thodari, 7 Naatkal and Inayathalam (which deals with cyber crime) in his kitty.\nGanesh is comfortable doing roles that makes sense to him as an artiste — even if that means not playing the lead. “When I sign a movie, I make sure that my character has a massive impact on the minds of the audience. To  me, only that matters,” he says.\nThe actor represented India at the Mr World Contest and made it to the top five back when he was a software programmer in Mumbai. He later quit his job as he found it mundane. “Acting seemed to be the logical option and to sustain yourself in the industry, you need to be versatile. I slowly ventured into theatre plays and commercials, and eventually started doing films,” he recalls.\nThough he has done quite a few films, Ganesh is still elated each time he sees himself on screen. “I am not here to measure success or show what hits mean to me. Besides expressing myself, I’ve always been keen on learning and enjoying the journey. Most of my roles I’ve done are character-driven ones. Wherever I go, people greet me with a warm smile; that keeps me happy,” he says.\nHaving portrayed a slew of cop characters, ask Ganesh if they are his favourite roles and he laughs, “Maybe Unnai Pol Oruvan has set a high standard for a cop role? I don’t know. But many directors have approached me for the same because I feel I’ve an apt physique and usually keep myself fit. I’m into gymming and do a bit of martial arts. After all, they (cops) are powerful characters that any leading Tamil actor can portray on screen. My grandfather was an assistant commissioner in Mumbai. But he died when my dad was barely 15. I handled all khaki-clad roles well and feel proud about it.”\nBut what if he gets stereotyped as an actor? “It’s not about me getting stereotyped at all! I’ve always wanted to build credibility as an actor. If the audience loves to see in more cop roles, why not?” he grins.\nGanesh counts himself lucky for having shared screen space with legends like Amitabh Bachchan, Mohanlal and Nagarjuna, among others. “I am a method actor myself and learnt a lot by observing those legends. Each one has his own method of preparation. I am open to all industries and can confidently say that I have a flair for languages. I can easily pick them up,” he says.\nIn Nayaki, while Trisha plays an aspiring actor, Ganesh will portray a cinematographer. “Set in the ‘70s, Nayaki is a retro horror comedy. I am a great admirer of Trisha. It’s good to act with her after almost eight years,” he smiles. Juggling TV reality shows and films, the actor says he took time to learn to balance both. “Life is all about learning,” he chuckles.\nSo, is there anyone he aspires to work with in particular? Ganesh says the list is pretty long, but adds, “I have immense respect for filmmakers as they create wonderful artistes like us. I want to work with Mani sir, Shankar sir, Rajkumar Hirani and new-age directors like Karthik Subbaraj and Nalan Kumarasamy. I am also open to working with anyone who would extract the best from me.”\nBefore concluding, he says he’d love to do a full-fledged romantic movie like Vaaranam Aayiram (2008). “Here’s a big shout-out to all filmmakers. I want to do roles like what Rajesh Khanna and Dev Anand saab did in Bollywood, because I am a true romantic at heart. You can ask my wife Nisha more about that,” he winks."}

They are trying to mislead people. The fact is they brought FDI in retail under foreign pressure.\"\nReferring to today's Congress rally at the Ramlila Maidan here, he said Congress just wants to show they have \"some support\" in the country.\n\"We want to tell people that the government is highly insensitive to the plight of farmers and small traders.

Bottled palm drinks such as ‘Palm Lahar’, ‘Palm Squash’ and ‘Palm Syrup’ are available in the stalls. ‘Palm Pine’, a mixture of various fruits, including pineapple and palm fruit, is the most popular drink. ‘Nongu’ and ‘pananga’ (palm fruit), and ‘akkani’ (palm sap) are the other edible items offered by KELPALM.\nVinod, owner of the KELPLAM franchise at Althara Junction, says his outlet witnesses a daily sales of around ` 4,000. “Most of the soft drinks are available for ` 10.

It is recommended especially for pregnant women.\nVinod started his franchise in Althara Junction four months ago. He also runs outlets at Thycaud and near the Railway Divisional Office. “During rainy season, ‘karipetti kappi’ was the hot favourite. Now, people need drinks that cool their body.

Eleven overnight trains, most of them superfast, pass via Tiruchi towards Chennai. All of the trains are predominantly jam-packed. There has always been a demand for more trains not only to Chennai but also other parts of the country.\nAnother eleven weekly trains, also pass via Tiruchi giving connectivity to Chennai, Tirupathi and some North Indian destinations. These trains enjoy good patronage and there have been consistent pleas to make them either regular services or increase their frequency.\nThe north bound weekly trains either departing or passing via Tiruchi are Tiruchi – Howrah bi-weekly express (on the chord line); Kanyakumari – Howrah weekly express (chord line); Madurai – Hazrath Nizamuddin Sampark Kranti bi-weekly express (chord line); Tiruneveli – Jammu Tawi bi-weekly link express (via Karur, Erode); Nagercoil – Mumbai CST bi-weekly express (chord line via Chengulpet); Rameshwaram – Bhubaneswar weekly express (main line), Rameshwaram – Varanasi weekly express (main line); Madurai – Tirupathi bi-weekly express (main line); Madurai – Chennai bi-weekly express (main line); Nagercoil – Chennai weekly express (via Karur,Erode) and Nagercoil – Chennai weekly express (chord line).\nThe Madurai – Tirupathi bi-weekly express, introduced a few months ago, serves the travelling public of both southern and central districts well. Travellers feel that the Railway should take steps for converting this train into a regular service.\nThis move will immensely benefit senior citizens and women. Travellers also point out that there was a daily train service between Maduai and Tirupathi before the meter gauge main line was closed for conversion into broad guage. The Railway assured to restore all trains which were running on the main line after the completion of gauge conversion. It is high time it is made a daily service, they say.\nThe people of the delta districts got an express train connectivity to the southern districts with the introduction of the Tiruchendur – Chennai – Tiruchendur, ‘Chendur' weekly and the Madurai – Chennai bi-weekly service, both on the main line. The Chendur express has been converted into a daily service. The Railway should similarly make the Madurai – Chennai bi-weekly also a daily service, say a cross section of the people from Thanjavur, Kumbakonam and Mayiladuthurai.\nSimilarly they want the frequency of Tiruchi – Howrah bi-weekly, the Tirunelveli – Jammu Tawi link bi-weekly, the Madurai – Hazrath Nizamuddin Sampark Kranti bi-weekly to be increased.\nSince these trains do not run daily, many commuters are not aware of it.

Africa doesn't choke this time - SPORT - The Hindu\nMarch 13, 2011 00:00 IST\nMarch 13, 2011 04:12 IST\nmore-in\nIndia fails to capitalise on the start provided by openers\nOn a day of fortune swings, Sachin Tendulkar conjured up a century and Dale Steyn sent down an inspired spell. And a lesser name, Robin Peterson, emerged the hero in an explosive climax.\nPursuing 297, South Africa required 13 runs from the final over bowled by left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra. South Africa did not choke on this occasion.\nPeterson edged a swipe to the boundary, dismissed the paceman beyond the mid-wicket ropes, collected a brace and then forced the bowler through covers to nail a sensational three-wicket win for his side in the Group B World Cup match at the Vidarbha Cricket Association ground here on Saturday.\nZaheer Khan had sent down an exceptional 49th over of control — he conceded only four runs. Peterson and Francois du Plessis, who displayed a calm head under pressure, had the last laugh.\nTurning point\nThe turning point of the match arrived much earlier when India, mismanaging its batting Power Play, collapsed from 267 for one to 296 all out in a span of 54 deliveries. Man-of-the-Match Steyn, mixing his pace and length and unleashing telling yorkers, picked up five wickets.\nThen, A.B. de Villiers came up with a blinder under pressure in the chase. Light on his feet, he was able to convert the length. South Africa came back from the brink.\nThe batting Power Play, from the 37th to the 41st overs, yielded South Africa a whopping 52 runs for the loss of a wicket. The side was back in the hunt.\nThe Indian bowling wilted under pressure conceding 99 runs in the last 11 overs. And the fielding, save on a couple of exceptions, was below international standards.\nYet, India called the shots at the start. With the surface becoming a tad slow, momentum eluded South African openers Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla.\nThe left-handed Smith never appeared comfortable before falling to his nemesis Zaheer Khan as the opener miscued a drive to mid-off.\nAsking rate climbs\nAs the ball got softer, finding boundaries became harder. Not quite middling the ball, Amla (61) and Kallis (69) were largely restricted to singles. As the partnership developed, the asking rate climbed. Yet, the two senior batsmen had built a platform.\nAmla, grassed by Yuvraj Singh at mid-wicket off Harbhajan on 57, soon succumbed to the off-spinner on the cut to a delivery that bounced a shade more; Dhoni held a smart catch. And the fighting Kallis was caught short of the crease after Harbhajan released a throw to Dhoni from widish fine-leg.\nThe host's batting folded after the openers Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag (73) had blitzed 142 runs in only 17.4 overs. Then Tendulkar and a fluent Gautam Gambhir (69) carried the score to 267 before Tendulkar fell.\nThe slide began with the batting Power Play taken from the 39th over — the home side lost four wickets for 30 runs in these five overs. The Indian batsmen lost their way tactically. And Steyn compounded their problems. Blistering spells of 2-0-7-2 and 1.4-0-2-3 of precision and swing by Steyn at the ‘death' cut short the Indian innings.\nSmith was spot on when he brought back Steyn and Morkel for the batting Power Play overs. Morkel achieved the breakthrough when Tendulkar sliced one to point.\nThen Steyn consumed Gambhir with a slower one and had Yusuf Pathan — promoted in the order — well caught by Smith at cover. The slide had begun and Kallis with his back-of-a-length variety and persistent left-arm spinner Peterson contributed to the South African cause as well.\nEarlier, Tendulkar delighted with his 99th international hundred; it was his 48th century in ODIs and sixth in the World Cup. His body and mind in harmony, Tendulkar bisected the field with flowing front-footed cover-drives. The maestro's broad blade came into view as Morkel was straight driven with grace and timing. When Steyn banged one in short, Tendulkar swiftly pulled him beyond the mid-wicket fence.\nTendulkar glided down the track to the spinners, drove, flicked and lofted with the touch and assurance of a wizard. And he used the depth of the crease for strokes behind square on either side.\nSehwag and Tendulkar stepped on the gas after Dhoni won the toss. India raced to 87 off the first 10 Power Play overs. Sehwag, reprieved by 'keeper van Wyk off Morkel on four, launched into the pacemen. A combination of the ability to pick the length early and exceptional bat speed enabled Sehwag to pierce the field. He also punished the pacemen with short-arm jabs on either side of the wicket.\nSehwag departed after attempting to create room to force leg-spinner du Plessis and playing on. Under pressure to produce a sizable innings, the left-handed Gambhir batted with composure and timing. He picked his ones and twos initially and then expanded his range of shots, a fleet-footed cover-drive off off-spinner Johan Botha catching the eye.\nIndia: V. Sehwag b du Plessis 73 ( 66b, 12x4), S.

He said it was abuse of process and that it did not constitute a criminal offence.\nToday, the Jubilee Hills police arrested two members of the film director's family.

He is all set to meet chief minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy and request him to cancel the liquor trade licences owned by white ration card holders in the state.\nEarlier, Satyanarayana had written to the chief minister demanding cancellation of the ration cards of those who held liquor licences. The move attracted criticism from the TDP which said ration card holders were being made scapegoats by the Congress leaders. This seems to have forced the PCC chief to change strategy.\nThe idea seems to be putting pressure on the government which anyway is not in a position to cancel the licences in view of the huge financial loss it involves at a time when the state’s finances are in a very bad shape. Botcha can then claim innocence while putting the chief minister under pressure.\nSources said Satyanarayana felt anyway it was better to cancel the liquor licences as the Anti-Corruption Bureau had termed the liquor trade as an organised crime.\nFurther, the PCC president is learnt to have decided to release a list soon of the shops held by Congress, TDP and YSR Congress leaders to counter the opposition allegations that the Congress leaders hold the  majority of liquor shops in the state."}

But to make use of all the material received would take several columns, so I propose to restrict myself to the occasional stand-alone piece arising from this wealth of information-in-brief. One reader pointed out that the Simon Commission was announced 80 years ago, on November 9, 1927, and in the ensuing months several Indians in provincial governments resigned. Another pointed out that an impassioned appeal by Annie Besant in Madras played a considerable role in inducing these resignations. One of those who resigned from the Madras Cabinet on March 8, 1928 was A. Ranganatha Mudaliar, the Minister for Development, who had been inducted into politics by the Raja of Paanagal. Ranganatha Mudaliar, after Madras Christian and Law College, joined Government Service and became a Deputy Collector. But becoming a staunch Theosophist and inspired by Annie Besant, he helped in establishing the Young Men's Indian Association in 1914 and was instrumental in the building of Gokhale Hall, which was inaugurated in 1915. He was also responsible for starting the YMIA's branch in South Madras. It was in Gokhale Hall that Annie Besant gave her `Wake Up India' lectures and in 1916 - 90 years ago - founded the Home Rule League. Elected to the Assembly from Bellary, his was a voice often heard in the Legislature questioning the Government's nominees. It was a voice that was stilled when Besant, with whom he had gone to London as a member of the unsuccessful National Convention delegation in 1924, appealed, \"Awake, arise, men and women of every caste, class, community! Your mother's voice calls you to make her mistress of her own household. Do not desert her in her hour of need. Boycott the Simon Commission!\"The first call for a boycott of the Commission was given by Sir P. S. Sivaswami Aiyer followed by Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Later, in Madras, early in 1928, the Legislative Council voted to boycott the Commission. The Premier, Dr. P. Subbaroyan, was one of the three members of the House who voted against the boycott. Besant's strident call followed. The Central Legislative Assembly also decided to have nothing to do with the Commission. When the Simon Commission arrived in Madras on February 26, they found themselves greeted by black flags and the city shut down by a hartal. A few days later, Ranganatha Mudaliar resigned together with fellow-Minister R. N. Arokiaswamy. He was, however, to persuade the Government to raise the statue for Annie Besant that now stands on the Marina. Ranganatha Mudaliar thereafter spent much time on Congress Party and Theosophical Society work till he was appointed the first Commissioner of the Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam in 1935. During his four years of office he introduced the counting of cash every day, ordered a diamond kreedam for the Lord, and contracted Gannon Dunkerley to improve the road to the temple and make it a motorable one. In later life, Ranganatha Mudaliar teamed with V. R. Ramalinga Mudaliar to start a sugar mill - India Sugars - in Hospet.S. MUTHIAH\nRelated Topics"}

The first phase of land acquisition for the project, where 1800-acres of land were acquired, went off smoothly. The trouble started when 2035 acres were notified for acquisition in the second phase in May 2007.\nThis was when the Samyukta Hitarakshana Samiti, spearheaded by Bhujanga Shetty, was upstaged by Krishi Bhoomi Samrakshana Samiti, led by Madhukar Ameen, in June 2007, as an organisation that represented farmers who were going to be displaced by the project. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, led by Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, also jumped into the fray. The efforts of the farmers were strengthened by environmental groups in the city. More than four thousand people turned up to voice their dissent during the November 28-public hearing on the environmental impact of the project.\nThey trashed the earlier claims of the promoters of the project that only a few errant individuals were trying to sabotage the SEZ. The launch of Mangalore-Yeshwanthpur Express train on December 8 came as a big relief to people who had borne the brunt of bad roads. Volvo buses, which earn Rs. 35-lakh a week for Mangalore division of KSRTC, dominated the road transport.\nAlthough the division registered better growth and was looking for more revenue, the introduction of the train to Bangalore has hit it and the private transportershard. Fishermen’s demands for dredging in the waters closer to the coast hardly got attention of the authorities. They had a poor season in October and November. Many fishermen did not venture into the sea fearing loss. Cuttlefish, an export species, eluded them. They were, however, happy that encroachment of fishing territory got good attention, with Goa and Karnataka Government announcing fishing holidays for the same period, unlike in the past.\nTwo merchant vessels, Den Den and Cheng Le Men bore the brunt of rough Arabian Sea at the height of monsoon. Three sailors from Den Den lost their lives, off the Tannirbhavi coast. The authorities concerned had to maintain a constant vigil against pollution from Den Den, which ran aground, close to the coast. Sailors on board Cheng Le Men were lucky that prompt salvage operations and favourable weather conditions did not see this beached vessel go the Den Den way.\nMajor power wrangling between the ruling combine and opposition Congress resulted in various rural development activities take a hit in the process. As many as 49 gram panchayats receiving the Nirmal Gram Puraskar from the then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a feather in the cap for the zilla panchayat.\nThe district, long regarded as the cradle of banking, took a logical step forward in complying with Reserve Bank of India’s norms in achieving financial inclusion. Concerted efforts the banks and non-governmental organisations, ensured that every household in the district had a “no-frills account”. Flight services to Baharain, Doha, Abudhabi and Mucat began from Bajpe airport. On the domestic front, new flight services to Goa, Kochi and Kozhikode, began.\nRelated Topics"}

Lakshmi Reddy intervened that they were allowed into the premises.\nEven as Dr. Reddy was addressing the public meeting, a mob of youngsters representing MRPS started waving banners carrying the letters ‘A-B-C-D’ and decrying the ‘injustice’ done to the community by not taking up categorisation of SCs. Startled at the sudden rise of slogans from the crowd, the thoroughly-embarrassed cops took to heels to control the mob, not before they caught the attention of the Chief Minister. Though irked at the sloganeering, Dr. ReddyYSR acknowledged them saying: Did I say No to ABCD? Shankar, a local industrialist and an aspirant for the Thamballapalle ticket left the venue in a huff, when he was reportedly asked to leave the dais.

What else explains the bizarre Rs 10.7-lakh crore estimate of the loss to the exchequer because of the manner in which coal blocks were given between 2004 and 2009? As our columnist today explains (Op-ed Page), this figure is equal to all the corporate taxes gathered in one year. The CAG quickly stepped in to distance itself from the report, saying it wasn't even a \"pre-final draft\" (whatever that means).\nBut the government cannot use the CAG's flight of fancy as its alibi. For, the way it allocated coal blocks and linkages to companies in core sectors such as power, cement and steel was certainly opaque. In the power sector, an estimated 40,000 MW of capacity is coming up on coal linkages and blocks handed out absolutely free, based almost entirely on a discretionary, point-based screening system. Despite getting these fuel linkages for free, most of these projects will sell the electricity generated in the market at commercial rates. So end-consumers do not stand to gain in terms of cheaper power because of the government's largesse in offering free coal. These include developers with not a single megawatt of capacity on the ground but clearly the leverage to get coal resources. The exceptions, though, include Central utilities such as NTPC Ltd and state-sector generating units which supply power at regulated rates, in which case the availability of cheaper coal resources is likely to be passed on to consumers at large.\nSeveral steel and cement sector players, too, got prized coal blocks for captive consumption. With supply consistently falling behind demand, coal has now become India's most prized mineral, coming at a time when the country is staring at a massive shortfall  about 142 million tonnes by the end of this fiscal. That the Centre has realised there is a problem is evident from the course-correction it is trying. The proposed Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill provides for the allocation of coal blocks through auction to private companies, replacing the current process.

Policemen were deployed in large numbers in the temple premises.\nThough the presence of a large number of civil rights activists, including Magsaysay Award winner Aruna Roy, and media persons from Jaipur gave confidence to the local Dalits to defy restrictions imposed by the Gujjars, tension in the atmosphere was palpable with a question mark raised over the stance of the Gujjars and higher castes on the issue.\nThe insinuation that Dalits were demanding a share in the 26-bigha agricultural land of the temple and offerings made to the deity was a deliberate ploy to shift attention from assertion of rights by Dalits to enter the temple and offer prayers as equal members of the Hindu community.\n\"We do not want a single inch of the land or a single paisa from the offerings. Ours is a struggle for self-respect,'' said Bhanwar Meghwanshi, the young convenor of Dalit Adivasi Adhikar Abhiyan.\nHe pointed out that Gujjar and Dalit priests had been worshipping Goddess Chawanda in the temple as a tradition, which was abruptly stopped for no reason other than hatred for Dalits. The Gujjar priest, Mewa Ram, accompanied by youngsters from his community allegedly thrashed the 80-year-old Dalit priest Hazari Balai during the Navratra festivities on October 1 and declared a ban on the entry of Dalits into the temple. The police registered an FIR after nine days following a great deal of persuasion, but have not arrested any of the 12 accused.\nThe Dalits' zeal to get justice could not be defeated by ploys such as registration of false cases against them alleging attempts to steal the offerings and clothes draped on the idol and violating peace. The Administration then tried to evolve a compromise without giving Dalits the right to enter the sanctum sanctorum.\nState Rural Development Minister Kalulal Gujjar, who is an MLA from neighbouring Mandal in Bhilwara district, was the target of attack at the public meeting attended by about 2,000 Dalits after entry into the temple. Mr. Gujjar brought members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's Scheduled Caste Morcha from other villages to Sulia on November 26 and \"staged a drama'' of taking them inside the temple.\nRelated Topics"}

The mega event, they say, was an opportunity to observe and learn from global trends in the publishing industry.\nThough some Indian publications did manage to find their way into the global market, the country certainly has a long way to go on this front, they admit.\n\"We get a chance to understand what is the universal and abiding value in books. Most exciting of all is the chance to see the best books from different cultures and understand them. It also gives us an international profile,\" says Sandhya Rao, senior editor, Tulika Publishers.\nBy the time the children's author, accompanied by publisher and managing editor Radhika Menon, returned to Chennai, a French publisher had already committed to one of their titles.\nTalking business\nThe Fair, which was held from October 4 to 8, was a platform for publishers, printers, distributors and persons from libraries to talk business. There is hardly any scope for physical sale of copies, say publishers. It is more about trade of rights, they add.\nThis year, India was the Guest of Honour at the fair. National Book Trust coordinated with publishers and ensured a considerable representation at the event.\nPublishers feel books published in India are looking better than they used to, with far more attention being given to packaging.\nAuthors, printers and artists from Tara Publishing also took part in the Fair. A book made entirely by hand was the highlight of their stall.\nTara's books have been published in 17 countries, with rights to over 75% of their titles sold in the international market.\nT.S.

Industry sources are blaming the dip, which has cast a shadow on the state’s tourism sector, on the European recession.\nSources in a leading shipping agency, which handles cruise vessels, said they have received confirmation of only 30 vessels till April next year. Months from November to April were always promising for Kochi, which is considered a sought-after port. The Cochin Port Trust website shows three cruise vessels are expected to call at the port in November.\nSince 2002, there has been a steady growth in the number of cruise vessels coming to Kochi.

One of them said to be named Misbahuddin Ahmed who reportedly comes from India. Search for more suspects is on.\nIt is the second Al-Qaeda-linked terror plot to be unearthed in Canada after the Toronto-18 plot of 2006 in which 18 Toronto-area Muslims were arrested for plotting to blow up Canadian targets, storm parliament, take leaders hostage and behead the prime minister. Eleven of these plotters were convicted.\nTerror suspects arrested Wednesday were under watch of the national security task force of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for months.\nAuthorities said the ringleader of the terror plot had travelled to the region between Pakistan and Afghanistan for training in weapons. Arrests were made when one of the suspects was about to travel abroad as part of the alleged plot, they said.\nThough police didn't name the suspects, one of them is said to be 36-year-old Misbahuddin Ahmed who worked as an X-ray technologist at an Ottawa hospital. Reports quoted sources as saying that Ahmed comes from India.\nRobert Farrell, a former Canadian diplomat who rented his place to Ahmed, told the Ottawa Citizen newspaper that the suspect told him that he was born in India but had lived for a time in Saudi Arabia.\n\"We met his wife at the time (of renting). She seemed quite nice. She wore an Iranian-style head covering (hijab). They seemed to be more of a traditional Muslim family,'' Farrell said.\nFive kilometre away from Ahmed's residence, police arrested another suspect who has been named Ahmed Ehsan in the media.\nReacting to the unearthing of the terror plot, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said , \"It is clear that Canada is not immune from international or homegrown radicalization. The government continues to participate in activities to better understand extremism throughout the world and the motivations of individuals who engage in terrorism.''\nAccording to security experts here, homegrown terrorist cells are plotting to target Canadian power plants and transmission lines which carry electricity to the US.\n\"There are ways of attacking the US through Canada. The whole energy for New York comes from Quebec (province), for example,'' security research expert Anthony Seaboyer was quoted as saying.\nIn fact, the famous Millennium Bomber Ahmed Ressam, an Al-Qaeda-linked Algerian who lived illegally in Canada and had plotted to blow up Los Angeles in December 199, had entered the US from Vancouver.\nThough Canada has tightened anti-terror laws after 9\/11, the Americans still find the response of its northern neighbour inadequate."}

Writer, director and producer Janardhan Maharshi uses senior citizens and stalwarts like K. Viswanath and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam to run a human drama with a light hearted approach but towards the end of the film, it brings a lump in your throat without being a deliberate tear jerker — just an unexpected yet perfect fit.\nThe performances are so astounding that it is difficult to point out who's the best out of the duo. While Viswanath is subtle, underplays his role, speaks volumes through his smiles, nods, indifference and tears. S. P. B. on the other hand is a live wire, gregarious but balanced. Both of them complement each other. They bring out the huge difference in their thinking, attitude and approach towards life.\nThe prelude says: For Srimannarayana (K.Viswanath) a temple is his home, but for Sambasiva (S. P. B.), a home is as good as a temple. One thinks that whatever the birth, the living is important and one should serve humanity and return this body to God in a pure form as pure as he was when he was born. The other is selfish and refuses to think about a third person other than himself and his wife. The first half of the film dwells on the budding friendship between the two strangers. Two different types of people and post the interval, the director focuses on the larger society. KV's dry sense of humour comes out through his witty one liners. His dialogues are full of pathos; his actions and songs range from politics, terrorism, civic sense, death and shine like pearls of wisdom, sans the preaching. Each scene is laden with wonderful lines and when the director falls short of them, he uses the visual to convey it perfectly. Aamani makes a fresh beginning and illuminates the screen with her presence. Janardhan Maharshi's casting is perfect. While the trio run the entire show, Kovai Sarala provides the comic relief. The film is worth watching for its strong performances, some crackling writing and a noble ambition. The length of the film is just right; it never loses its emotional momentum and maintains clarity in dialogues throughout. Devasthanam is a re-invention of octogenarian K.Viswanath. He is back in his element, warm, empathetic and in full authority of his character. S. P. B. is the common man's alter ego and the film is sure to fetch a bag of encomiums.\ny. sunita chowdhary"}
