totalling 3,530 - are plying under dtc's kilometre scheme to ply their vehicles. if they don't comply, their permits would be terminated.\" another 900 dtc buses plying on inter state routes would also be pressed into service in case of an emergency, mehta said. the transport minister lashed out at former chief minister madanlal khurana alleging he was trying to gain political mileage by calling for the day-long strike. \"we have utmost faith in the supreme court. we would request the court not to proceed with the cng conversion process till the cng infrastructure is in place,\" hashmi said. schools to remain closed although there has been no official directive from the delhi government, a majority of the capital's private schools have decided to remain closed on tuesday due to the transporters' strike. schools remaining closed include springdales (dhaula kuan and pusa road), bluebells, mothers international, mater dei and guru harkishan public school (all the 10 branches). \"we have faced enough problems in such situations. we don't want to risk the security of our children,\" another principal added. though many principals feel that they cannot afford another holiday in the already tight school calender, they prefer to play it safe. guru harkishan school principal i s narang said the decision to close all the branches was a centralised management decision. the transport minister's decision to suspend the permits of transporters depending on the feedback of schools may prove to be ineffective, with many schools already having taken the decision by monday afternoon. \"the schools were not aware of any such decision by the transport minister,\" a principal said. \"such late decisions don't make sense. they just put the parents and students to inconvenience,\" said birla vidya niketan principal madhu chandra. her school has not been declared closed. interestingly, even schools who have their own fleets have also decided to remain closed. in springdales, pusa road, for instance, all the 28 buses are owned by the school. \"four diesel buses have not been converted as yet and therefore we do not want to take any chances,\" said principal amita wattal. more so, a few senior class students have their third language test on tuesday. \"we don't want a uncertain situation if some students are not able to turn up,\" wattal added. one of the schools is being forced to remain open, particularly because it has organised an international debate. \"we will be sending the school's seven buses on usual routes but are expecting a thin attendance,\" the school principal said. students of sanskriti school in chanakyapuri have been issued a circular stating \"the school would remain closed if the transporters persist with their proposed strike on tuesday.\" the delhi public school, mathura road, will remain open. students who commute through private contract buses are likely to face a problem. \"the school is considerably far off from my residence, but i will have to drop my child to school,\" a parent of a class viii student said. the delhi abhibhavak mahasangh, a parents' group, has requested education minister narendra nath to declare a holiday on tuesday. \"the worst sufferers will be the primary and secondary schoolchildren. most schools are conducting unit tests and parents are forced to send the kids to school,\" dam president vijender kumar said.</td>\n",

Apparently, irked with the agreement between the Treasury Benches and the main Opposition, the BSP stalled the passage of the Bill and forced the House to adjourn twice.\\nWhile giving clarifications, Kapil Sibal said,”The reservation policy applies to admissions in institutions. There is no reservation policy which applies to faculty”.\\nTaking strong exceptions to Sibal’s remarks, the BSP members rushed to the well forcing the House to be adjourned. Though Sibal realised his mistake and expressed ‘sorry’, it was too late. As Deputy Chairman K Rahman Khan was about to ask for a voice vote for the passage of the Bill without discussion, trouble started when ruling Congress member Jesudasu Seelam raised the issue of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs in the institutes of national importance. This prompted the BSP and other parties to seek for a proper discussion on the Bill.\\nAccusing the Congress and the BJP for reaching an agreement to pass the Bill without discussion, BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra made it clear that this Bill cannot be passed without discussion, particularly on reservation. Rahman Khan had to adjourn the House for 15 minutes.\\nWhen the House reassembled, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley asked the government to clarify on the reservations.\\nBSP leader S C Mishra wanted specific provisions in the Bill for reservation.\\nCPI leader D Raja wanted to know what was the guarantee of implementing the policy effectively in the interest of SCs, STs and OBCs. DMK member Tiruchi Siva also wanted assurance from the government on reservation. After the clarification from Kapil Sibal, members from the BSP, BJD and LJP rushed to the well and shouted slogans against the government. The chair adjourned the House for 30 minutes. Though the House reassembled again, it was adjourned after the statement of the Home Minister on the Delhi High Court blast.</td>\n",

Balagopal Memorial Lecture here on Sunday. Mr. Khalid who called himself an anti-national, branded so by the media, said students’ movements posed the biggest threat to Hindutva forces and an attack on campuses after BJP ascended to power was expected. “When they went after Rohith Vemula they were not attacking a person. They were attacking a student leader and a fighter. They were also attacking Ambedkarite politics,” he said adding the BJP government tried to disrupt ‘justice for Rohith Vemula movement’ by cracking down on JNU students, including himself who supported Kashmir’s right to self determination.\\nNew solidarities\\nMr. Khalid said the slogan ‘Jai Bhim, Lal Salam’ that developed out of larger solidarities between students brings a ray of hope of meeting of two ideologies. The question of caste and the question of patriarchy are very important questions of times and these questions are internal to revolutionary transformation, Mr. Khalid, who holds a radical Left world-view, said.\\nChallenging the government who ‘tried to rein-in students’, Mr. Khalid said: “They wanted to teach us a lesson. But we haven’t learnt that lesson. We will continue to uphold our political views.” Remembering Mr. Balagopal, who was a renowned lawyer, writer and activist, had helped contextualise political movements of his times, Mr. Khalid said “You could either agree or disagree with him but you could never have ignored him.” Human Rights Forum organised the meet to commemorate the seventh death anniversary of Mr. Balagopal.\\nStruggle for rights\\nOther speakers in the meet included member Communist Party of India’s National Council and president of Adivasi Mahasabha Manish Kunjam, faculty member in University of Hyderabad K. Y. Ratnam and Zameer Ahmed of Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society.\\nMr. Kunjam, who has been working in conflict-affected Bastar of Chhattisgarh, said the condition of Adivasis in Bastar is as bad as Kashmiris. From media blackout to targeting leaders, Bastar police has tried every possible way to suppress people’s movements for rights. Prof. Ratnam, who was one of the faculty members who got arrested during the unrest in UoH on March 22, rejected Justice Roopanwal Commission report that declared Rohith Vemula non-Dalit.\\nRelated Topics</td>\n",

              "      <td>Aurangzeb's Discriminatory Policies\\n2014-08-28 06:00:00\\nAurangzeb’s obsessive drive to harass and convert all infidels to Islam led him to promulgate laws that were not only blatantly discriminatory but also petty and mean towards the minorities. For instance, he ordered that no Hindu should ride a palanquin, an Arab horse or an elephant without permission. However, Aurangzeb was shrewd enough to realise that he could not apply these restrictions to the Rajputs or other martial communities whose services the Mughals could not do without. And so the Rajputs and other Hindu clans who were on the payroll of the Mughal army were exempt from these regulations. In Aurangzeb’s eyes, the Shias were as good as infidels but he did not allow his prejudice to interfere with political expediency.\\nWhen an amir complained to him about the prominent role played by the Shia Persians in the court, the wily Aurangzeb rebuked him saying that “religion had no place in worldly affairs.” But it was the Jizya that became the most dramatic and blatantly racist expression of Aurangzeb’s anti-Hindu policies. The Jizya was abolished by Akbar in 1564, but on April 12, 1679, Aurangzeb reimposed it. The promulgation of this tax on Hindus was not only opposed by the Hindus but also by important Muslims in the court who argued that the tax was against the tenets of the Mughal empire. But Aurangzeb was stubborn. Even his beloved sister Jahanara pleaded with him, but in vain. She warned him that such a measure could create irreparable fissures in the kingdom.\\nAn earthquake struck Delhi after the reimposition of the Jizya, which was a bad omen. Entreaties were made to the emperor again to reconsider his decision but it was not to be. On the contrary, Aurangzeb said that the trembling of the earth was an expression of the joy it felt at the measures he was adopting towards the propagation of Islam. Jahanara’s warning of a rebellion almost became a reality when large numbers of Hindus congregated in Delhi in an attempt to persuade the emperor. One day, when he went to public prayer in the great mosque on the Sabbath, a vast multitude of Hindus thronged the road all the way from the palace to the mosque, hoping against hope that the crowd would weigh on the emperor to reconsider his decision.\\nDespite his orders to force a way through, it became impossible for the emperor to reach the mosque. An order was given to bring out the elephants and direct them against the mob. Predictably many were trodden to death.  Yet many Hindus continued to protest. But finally they had no choice but to give in and pay the Jizya. Some Brahmins in Delhi went on a fast against the Jizya but they too had to swallow their pride and give in when they saw that other Hindus had  started paying the Jizya.\\nIt was the ordinary Hindus and their local leaders who stood up to protest against the Jizya. There was barely a murmur of protest from the Hindu chiefs serving the emperor who had their careers to think about. Shivaji was the only Hindu king who protested. But he was Aurangzeb’s bitter foe  and had nothing to lose.  He wrote a long letter that dripped with sarcasm to the emperor. In the letter, he taunted Aurangzeb saying that the emperor of Hindustan covets beggar’s bowls, takes Jizya from Brahmins and Jains, yogis, sanyasis, bairagis, paupers and the famine-stricken. By his attacks on the wallets of beggars, he had brought dishonour to his ancestors. He reminded Aurangzeb that the Quran referred to god as ‘rabb-ul-alamin’ or ‘lord of all men’ and not ‘rabb-ul-musalmin’ or ‘lord of the Muhammadans’.  Shivaji argued that the Jizya was not only unjustifiable but also unlawful. Even when Aurangzeb was told that the Jizya was driving Hindu traders away from the Mughal territory in the Deccan, he remained indifferent and rejoiced when he learnt that many Hindus had turned Muhammadean as they were unable to pay the Jizya.</td>\n",

The four districts of Nadia, Murshidabad, Malda and Birbhum, where polling will be held on Monday, are Congress strongholds, and the shadow of widescale violence looms large as over 80 per cent of booths in this phase are either marked as 'highly sensitive' or 'sensitive'.\\nPolice said two Congress workers  Nurmohhamad Sheikh and Ahad Ali  were killed after being hit by crude bombs late Saturday night at Kapasdanga in Murshidabad district. TMC workers have been accused of leading the attacks. There were reports of skirmishes and clashes, including stone pelting, in the area in which two policemen were injured. Another Congress worker, Repon Sheikh, was killed at Bharatpur in the same district during a clash between rival party supporters, the police said.\\nSpeaking to a TV news channel, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee shrugged off the allegations that Trinamool cadres were behind the killing of the Congress workers. Accusing the CPM of instigating the violence, she said the deaths were result of clashes between the Congress and the Marxists.\\nEarlier in the day, in a statement posted on Trinamool website, the Chief Minister said in the fourth and fifth phases of the elections, where the Congress \"has a presence, the party will deliberately be up to mischief\".\\nBut Congress MP and Union minister from Murshidabad Adhir Chowdhury blamed the Trinamool for the violence. \"Trinamool is trying to create disturbances in tomorrow's elections, which is the reason why they are issuing such statements.\" He alleged that the police did act to prevent such incidents despite the party giving them inputs about the violence beforehand. \"The miscreants, who were earlier with the CPM and have recently joined the TMC, are responsible for the violence,\" Chowdhury said.</td>\n",

''i was being charged $4 for a trip to india gate. i did not go as my co-passengers asked me to wait till afternoon,'' an israli tourist said. passengers who arrived in rajdhani and shatabdi expresses between 10 am and 11 am had to wait for autorickshaws. at both airports the situation was normal as private taxis plied at pre-paid booths. around 60 instances of violence were reported from noida, mukherjee nagar, tilak nagar, trilokpuri, punjabi bagh, shakarpur and trans-yamuna areas. several transport unions, backed by bjp mp madanlal khurana, had given the call for strike, demanding an ordinance allowing low sulphur diesel for existing diesel-run buses. his call for a demonstration at rajghat, however, did not elicit much of a response. fearing overcrowded buses, many students did not venture out. in delhi university, the attendance fell to 50 per cent. some schools declared the day off. government schools remained open.</td>\n",

They pertained to food and its quality, accommodation, difficulty in reaching the venue, the Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa College grounds, choked toilets, and the biting cold in evenings. However, many were of the opinion that ‘everything was good’ since a tiny place such as Madikeri was hosting the show.

They reaffirmed their faith in dance and music as they would do during the famous Madikeri Dasara festivities.\\nPolicemen had a tough job in controlling the crowd, indulging in verbal duels with people.

The inquiry, conducted under the supervision of Khan, zeroed in on the panel of five teachers who were appointed by the University to set the question-paper and the name of the teacher was ascertained, RU spokesperson S S Akhter said.\\nLater, in a meeting, headed by the V-C on Thursday, the University decided to permanently debar the teacher from taking part in any of its examination activities, and to explore possibility of a legal action against him. It also decided to write to the V-C of the University in Bihar, which he represented, for initiating disciplinary action against him. On Friday, the RU\\nV-C's office had already dispatched the letter in this regard, marking it as 'strictly confidential'.\\nMeanwhile, normalcy returned in the University campus and there was no untoward incident reported from any corner of the city as policemen patrolled the Muslim dominated areas of Hindpiri, Gudri and Kasai Mohalla here.\\nHowever, when asked, an undergraduate student of the university, Shakeel Ahmed, said: \"Today or tomorrow or whenever we learn about the man who had set that question, we would teach him the lesson he deserves\".</td>\n",

One of them said to be named Misbahuddin Ahmed who reportedly comes from India. Search for more suspects is on.\\nIt is the second Al-Qaeda-linked terror plot to be unearthed in Canada after the Toronto-18 plot of 2006 in which 18 Toronto-area Muslims were arrested for plotting to blow up Canadian targets, storm parliament, take leaders hostage and behead the prime minister. Eleven of these plotters were convicted.\\nTerror suspects arrested Wednesday were under watch of the national security task force of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for months.\\nAuthorities said the ringleader of the terror plot had travelled to the region between Pakistan and Afghanistan for training in weapons. Arrests were made when one of the suspects was about to travel abroad as part of the alleged plot, they said.\\nThough police didn't name the suspects, one of them is said to be 36-year-old Misbahuddin Ahmed who worked as an X-ray technologist at an Ottawa hospital. Reports quoted sources as saying that Ahmed comes from India.\\nRobert Farrell, a former Canadian diplomat who rented his place to Ahmed, told the Ottawa Citizen newspaper that the suspect told him that he was born in India but had lived for a time in Saudi Arabia.\\n\"We met his wife at the time (of renting). She seemed quite nice. She wore an Iranian-style head covering (hijab). They seemed to be more of a traditional Muslim family,'' Farrell said.\\nFive kilometre away from Ahmed's residence, police arrested another suspect who has been named Ahmed Ehsan in the media.\\nReacting to the unearthing of the terror plot, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said , \"It is clear that Canada is not immune from international or homegrown radicalization. The government continues to participate in activities to better understand extremism throughout the world and the motivations of individuals who engage in terrorism.''\\nAccording to security experts here, homegrown terrorist cells are plotting to target Canadian power plants and transmission lines which carry electricity to the US.\\n\"There are ways of attacking the US through Canada. The whole energy for New York comes from Quebec (province), for example,'' security research expert Anthony Seaboyer was quoted as saying.\\nIn fact, the famous Millennium Bomber Ahmed Ressam, an Al-Qaeda-linked Algerian who lived illegally in Canada and had plotted to blow up Los Angeles in December 199, had entered the US from Vancouver.\\nThough Canada has tightened anti-terror laws after 9/11, the Americans still find the response of its northern neighbour inadequate.</td>\n",
